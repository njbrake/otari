    The resolved spelling catches the other direction, which the lexical one
    cannot: an innocuous name aliased to a real secret.

    Either may land outside the repo, and one that does is dropped rather than
    abandoning the collection: a policy can only name paths inside the repo,

    nothing, so nothing resolves from it: no hooks, since Claude Code walks
    up from `cwd` looking for a `.claude/settings.local.json` and finds none
    there, narrower than `--safe-mode`'s guarantee (project-scoped only, not
    a hypothetical user- or enterprise-level hook), which does not matter

    Codex's own non-interactive one-shot mode: the prompt goes over stdin
    (`-` in place of a positional prompt argument, `codex exec`'s own way of
    reading one), matching `_hook_call_claude_p`'s own choice for the same
    reason (a diff or transcript can carry an embedded NUL byte, which
    `subprocess` rejects in an argv element but not in piped input).

    `--sandbox read-only` and `--ask-for-approval never` keep this call from

    tool/MCP definitions from the prompt entirely the way `_hook_call_claude_p`'s
    `--tools ""`/`--strict-mcp-config` do, so this only bounds what an
    attempted tool call could *do*, not whether the model attempts one; the

    `_hook_call_claude_p` returns: `codex exec` prints only the final agent
    message to stdout, progress to stderr, matched here by parsing that
    stdout as the single JSON object the prompt demands.

    Codex's own rejection wording for an oversize prompt has not been

    itself is signed into, not billed through Otari.

    `model` is the caller's own explicit choice (`--judge-model`/
    `OTARI_HOOK_JUDGE_MODEL`), or `None` for "no explicit choice, use this

    the two are not symmetric here). Resolved after `judge_cli`, not before:
    which default applies depends on which backend actually gets picked.

    `judge_cli` is the already-resolved preference order for this one gate

    makes a bare, single-entry list behave exactly as a hardcoded "claude"
    always did before this existed.

    `dry_run` skips the real call entirely, before ever touching `shutil.which`
    or `subprocess`: the wire contract has no fourth outcome to spell "this
    was never really run", so it reports the same `"error"` a real failed

    whole run, not a fresh one per call.

    A "prompt is too long" rejection retries once with `transcript` dropped
    entirely: the transcript is supplementary "why" context for a judge
    rubric, the diff is the primary evidence, so a diff-only retry is a
    strictly better fallback than reporting no verdict at all. Only for that
    specific rejection, only once, and only against the `claude` backend
    (`_hook_call_codex_exec`'s own docstring says why Codex gets no

    evaluates below, so there is one parse of a guardrail per hook event and
    no way for the gates judged here to differ from the gates checked there.

    A judge gate with `when_changed` is skipped locally, before ever reading
    the diff/transcript or shelling out to `claude -p`, when none of
    `changed_paths` matches its globs (`domain.evaluators.matched_changed_paths`,
    the same grammar `evaluate_judge`'s own applicability check uses

    for a skipped gate resolves `not_applicable` there independently, the
    same as it would if this function ran the model call and got `pass`
    anyway. A gate with no `when_changed` at all keeps its unconditional,
    every-Stop-event behavior.

    `judge_dry_run` (see `hook`'s own `--judge-dry-run`) still runs this whole
    applicability check, still reads the diff and transcript, and still
    writes the same `_hook_log_judge_call` audit lines; only `_hook_run_judge`
    itself skips the real model-CLI call. This is what makes the resulting
    log a real count of how often the model would have been invoked, not a
    guess: everything up to the call itself runs exactly as it would for real.

    `harness` picks which transcript format `transcript_path` is read as
    (Claude Code's Message-API transcript vs. Codex's rollout JSONL). It also
    supplies the *default* judge_cli order (`_JUDGE_CLI_DEFAULT_BY_HARNESS`)
    for a gate that names none of its own: precedence, most specific first,
    is a gate's own `JudgeGate.judge_cli`, then this call's own
    `judge_cli_override` (`hook`'s own `--judge-cli`/`OTARI_HOOK_JUDGE_CLI`),
    then that harness default. A gate or override naming more than one CLI is
    an ordered fallback list, resolved by `_hook_resolve_judge_cli`: the first
    entry whose own binary is on PATH is what actually gets invoked.

    Gates run concurrently (a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, not `asyncio`: each
    worker's own time is spent blocked inside `subprocess.run`, ordinary
    blocking I/O a thread waits on fine, not a coroutine-friendly awaitable),
    capped at `_HOOK_GATE_MAX_WORKERS` at once. `_hook_log_judge_call` is
    safe to call from every worker thread (`_HOOK_JUDGE_LOG_LOCK`); nothing
    else a worker touches is shared mutable state (`diff`/`transcript`/
    `deadline` are read-only from every worker's own perspective, and
    `_hook_judge_workdir()` is a directory each `claude -p`/`codex exec`
    subprocess uses independently, not a file the workers write themselves).

    """Run one verifier gate's verifier script; return (outcome, detail).

    The exit-code contract is fixed, not something a caller or this command
    decides: 0 is "pass", 1 is "fail", anything else -- a different exit
    code, a crash, a missing or non-executable script -- is "error". This is
    what lets `enforcement: required` genuinely block for this gate type,
    unlike `judge`: the contract is reproducible, not a model's opinion.

    `verifier` is resolved against `repo_root` and, before it is ever run,
    confirmed to still resolve inside it (mirrors the same guard the
    PreToolUse edit-path branch above applies to its own target path): a
    policy naming `../../etc/passwd` or an absolute path domain.policy
    already rejects at parse time, but a relative path can still climb out
    with enough `..` segments, and running whatever that resolves to would
    be a materially different, undocumented capability, not "run a
    repo-local script".

    No sandboxing beyond that check, and no guard requiring the script to
    predate the diff under check, deliberately: see VerifierGate's own
    docstring and docs/agent-guardrails.md for why. `cwd` is the repo root, so a
    verifier that wants to inspect the working tree (`git diff`, `git
    status`, a plain file scan) can do so exactly the way a Makefile target
    or a pre-commit hook already checked into the repo would.

    Captured stdout, capped at `_HOOK_MAX_CHECK_DETAIL_LENGTH`, is the
    verdict's detail regardless of outcome; stderr is not read, since the
    wire contract has no separate slot for it and stdout is what a verifier
    author is expected to write the human-readable reason to. It is decoded
    as UTF-8 with `errors="replace"` for the same reason
    `_hook_collect_diff` does it: a verifier that echoes a tracked file's
    own bytes can emit something that is not valid UTF-8, and strict
    decoding raises `UnicodeDecodeError` from inside `subprocess` itself,
    which would escape this function and take every other gate in the
    policy down with it before the request ever reached the Hook Server.

    The verifier leads a process group of its own (`start_new_session`) so
    that the timeout reaches its descendants too. Stopping the verifier alone
    leaves anything it backgrounded running, still holding the stdout and
    stderr pipes it inherited, past both this call's cap and the whole run's
    shared budget; on a platform whose timeout cleanup reads those pipes
    (Windows) that is a hang, and everywhere it is at least an orphan the
    gate spawned and never reclaimed.

    `evaluate_verifier`'s own applicability check uses server-side): the

    changes the day a source for shell write or read targets exists, and not
    before.

    `read` is the opposite: it turns on `runs` alone, since a read gate and an

Common to every gate: `id` (unique, short, kebab-case, at most 200 characters),
`type`, `enforcement` (`required` or `advisory`), and `runs`, a
non-empty list naming when the gate runs and what it can see there.

`message` is optional and each gate type has a generic fallback, so propose one
only where it says something the gate's own fields do not: the mitigation to
apply instead ("use --force-with-lease"), or the doc section the rule came
from. On a `judge` gate, propose one only if it names the mitigation; a message that
restates the rubric sitting one field above it is the same sentence twice. Each gate
type accepts only certain `runs` values, and there is no default:

- path: `pre_tool_use.edit_target`, `pre_tool_use.read_target`, `stop.working_tree`, or any combination
- command: `pre_tool_use.command`
- command_if_changed: `stop.session`
- judge: `stop.session`
- verifier: `stop.verifier`

`pre_tool_use.edit_target` is the path an Edit/Write/NotebookEdit call names
before it runs, so a match refuses the write. It cannot see a path a shell
command writes (a redirect, sed -i, cp, a script). `stop.working_tree` is what
git status reports once the turn is over: complete whatever wrote the file, but
always after the fact. Propose both for a path gate unless the path is
only ever written by a build or a generator, in which case propose
`[stop.working_tree]` alone, because no tool call will ever name it.

`pre_tool_use.read_target` is the path a Read call names before it runs, so a
match refuses the read and the file's contents never enter the transcript.
Propose it only for a rule about *reading* a file (a secret, a credential, a
key), never as an extra entry on a "do not hand-edit this" gate, where it would
refuse merely looking at the file. It cannot see a shell read (cat, less), and
unlike a write there is no `stop` value that catches one afterwards, because a
read changes nothing: if the doc also wants shell reads refused, propose a
separate command gate for that.

- path: fails when a changed path matches one of `forbidden`, a list
  of repo-relative POSIX globs (`*` within one path segment, at most one `**`
  crossing segments per glob). Use for "this generated/forbidden file must
  never be hand-edited".
- command: fails when a run command matches one of `forbidden`, a list
  of shell phrases (e.g. "npm install", "git push --force"), matched as a
  contiguous token run, not a substring. Use for "use tool X, not tool Y".
- command_if_changed: fails when a path matching `when_changed` (same glob
  grammar as path) changed but none of `require` (same phrase
  grammar as command) ran. Use for "if this generated artifact
  changed, its generator command must have run".
- verifier: a repo-local verifier script's own exit code decides the
  outcome (0 pass, 1 fail, anything else error). Needs `verifier`, a
  repo-relative path. Only propose this when the doc names, or clearly
  implies, a script that already exists in the repo; never invent a path.
- judge: a model verdict against a free-text `rubric`. `enforcement` MUST be
  `advisory` (a required judge gate is invalid and will be rejected). Use
  only for a genuinely subjective rule no mechanical check can express;
  prefer one of the other four types whenever the rule is checkable
  mechanically.

Optional on command_if_changed/judge/verifier: `when_changed` (same glob
grammar as path's `forbidden`) scopes when the gate applies; required
for command_if_changed, optional (defaults to "always") for the other two.

    Both are always present: a path with no spelling inside the repo is
    refused outright above, and every other path has a PreToolUse moment now
    that `hook` submits the lexical spelling as well as the resolved one.

    A gate's globs are repo-relative POSIX, and matching `--path`
    literally would report `quiet` for the absolute or `./`-prefixed spelling a
    person naturally types while a real session matches it: a silent false
    clean, which is the failure this whole command exists to remove.

    The two spellings differ only for a symlink, and differ for a reason.
    `hook`'s PreToolUse branch calls `.resolve()`, which is how an absolute
    `file_path` becomes repo-relative and which follows a link on the way. Its
    Stop branch reads `git status`, which reports the tracked name, link and
    all. Using one spelling for both reports a gate forbidding the link's own
    name as `quiet` at Stop, where a real session fails it.

    Three spellings are tried for the working tree, in order, because a repo
    can be named through an alias: purely lexical, then with the directory
    resolved but the final name kept, then fully resolved. The middle one is
    what an absolute path through an alias needs (`/tmp/repo/CLAUDE.md` where
    the repo is really at `/private/tmp/repo`): without it the lexical attempt
    fails, the fully resolved fallback follows the file's own link too, and
    the Stop spelling silently becomes the link's target again.

    nested ones included. Cross-file problems are found here and only here,
    because no single file can show them: a gate id declared twice across the
    set, or more judge gates in total than one Stop event will run.
    `--guardrail-file` narrows it back to one file, which is how a snippet
    from somewhere else is checked before being dropped in.

    Offline and gateway-free: it parses the guardrail the same way a
    submitted one is parsed, then reports what running it would have taught
    the hard way. An error is a gate that cannot do its job (a missing or
    unrunnable verifier script). A warning is a gate that runs and may not
    mean what its author intended: a `**` glob that cannot reach the
    repository root, a one-token forbidden phrase that also refuses commands
    merely mentioning the word, a path gate blind to every shell write, more
    judge gates than one Stop event evaluates. A warning never fails on its
    own, since each has a legitimate exception; `--strict` is what makes one
    non-zero, for CI.

    `--command` and `--path` answer the other question, "does it say
    what I think it says", by evaluating the guardrail against evidence you
    supply at each moment a real session would offer it: one PreToolUse call
    per command or path, then the Stop event with all of them together. A
    gate firing there is the answer, not a failure, so it does not change the
