    A `#` starts a comment only at the start of a word (the start of the
    command, or right after unquoted whitespace or one of Bash's own
    metacharacters, `_METACHARACTERS`) and only outside any quoting. The
    metacharacters matter as much as the whitespace: `ls;# npm install` is
    entirely a comment to Bash, and treating only whitespace as ending a
    word left the commented-out text to be matched as if it were a real
    command. `shlex`'s own `comments=True` is not used here: it treats *any*
    `#` as starting a comment, even mid-word, which is not what a shell does
    (`echo a#b` prints `a#b`, not `a`) and is not safe for this purpose: a
    URL fragment or a `--flag=value#123` mid-command would silently swallow
    everything after it, including a genuinely separate, later command
    joined by `&&`/`;`/`|`. `git commit -m "fix #123"` (a `#` inside a
    quoted argument) is not a comment either way, POSIX or `comments=True`;
    what differs is exactly this word-boundary rule.

    A comment extends only to the end of its own physical line, not to the
    end of the whole string: a multi-line command's own earlier comment
    (`# a note\nnpm install`) must not swallow a real, later command on the
    next line. The newline itself is kept (shlex already treats it as
    ordinary whitespace), so scanning continues normally right after it,
    including into a comment of its own on that next line.

    A backslash escapes the character right after it wherever it appears
    outside single quotes (unquoted, or inside double quotes), so an
    escaped double quote cannot end the quote it is inside, and an escaped
    `#` cannot start a comment. This is a deliberate over-approximation of
    the narrower real rule for what a backslash escapes inside double
    quotes (`$`, `` ` ``, `"`, `\\`, or a newline): it only matters here for
    whether a character is a real closing `"` or a real comment `#`, and
    treating any other escaped character as "not that" changes nothing.

    Bash's ANSI-C quoting, `$'...'`, is not a plain single-quoted string:
    backslash escapes are active inside it, so an escaped apostrophe (`\\'`)
    is literal content, not the closing quote, unlike a real `'...'`. Left
    to `shlex` (which knows only POSIX quoting), a closing `\\'` reads as
    real, and `shlex.split` then either raises on the now-unbalanced
    trailing quote or, before that, this function treated it the same as a
    plain single quote closing, mistaking whatever followed for a fresh,
    unquoted word, `#` included. Rewritten here into an equivalent plain
    `'...'` shlex can already tokenize (an embedded, escaped apostrophe
    becomes close-quote, escaped-quote, reopen-quote, `'\\''`), so a
    forbidden token inside a `$'...'` argument is found the same as inside
    any other quoting.

    open on any command whose operator was written without spaces, which is
    how people actually type the commonest of them: `npm install;` tokenized
    to `["npm", "install;"]`, matching no phrase, and `(npm install)` to
    `["(npm", "install)"]`, matching none either.

    A `&` belonging to a redirect (`2>&1`, `&>out`) is left alone: it joins a
    file descriptor to a redirect target rather than ending a command, and
    padding it would split one command into two segments at a point no shell
    does.

    A bare newline becomes a `;` for the same reason. Left as the ordinary
    whitespace shlex treats it as, `git\\npush` (two one-word commands)
    merges into one segment `["git", "push"]` and falsely matches the
    two-word phrase naming one command. It is also what puts a command at
    its own segment's head, where `_contains_subsequence` applies the
    basename equivalence: `echo hi\\n/usr/bin/npm install`, unsplit, has
    `/usr/bin/npm` at a non-zero position, where that equivalence does not.

    Meant to run on `_strip_shell_comment`'s own output, which has already

    to track plain single/double quotes and backslash escaping, not ANSI-C
    quoting a second time. A quoted newline (inside `'...'` or `"..."`) is
    real content, not a boundary, and is left untouched. A backslash before
    a newline, outside single quotes, is a line continuation: a real shell
    deletes both characters, joining the two physical lines with nothing
    between them, so this does too, rather than leaving the pair for shlex.
    Left alone, shlex only treats that escaped newline as "not a word
    break," not as deleted: `shlex.split("git \\\npush --force")` gives
    `["git", "\\npush", "--force"]`, a literal newline still embedded in
    the second token, which then never equals the plain word `push` a
    forbidden phrase names, letting `git push --force` typed across two
    continued lines pass a gate forbidding exactly that.

    """Split a command into simple-command segments, each already tokenized.

    Strips a trailing comment, pads every unquoted separator and bare newline
    so shlex will isolate it (`_normalize_separators`), then tokenizes with
    `shlex` (POSIX quoting rules), then splits the resulting token list on
    any token that is exactly one of `COMMAND_SEPARATORS`: a quoted argument
    that happens to contain that text, like `"a && b"`, survives as a single
    token from shlex and is never mistaken for a separator, since this only
    looks at whole tokens, never substrings of one.

    Each segment's own first token, the command actually being invoked for
    that segment, is later compared by path basename rather than literally
    (`_contains_subsequence`), so a path-qualified invocation of an
    executable matches a phrase naming it unqualified and vice versa. That
    equivalence is applied at comparison time, not by rewriting a token
    here: this function's own output is always the literal tokens a
    caller's command actually contained.

    A command shlex cannot tokenize even after comment-stripping (an
    unbalanced quote outside any comment) falls back to a plain whitespace
    split. Keeping it as one opaque token instead was a silent fail-open:
    `npm install "unterminated` never equals the single-token phrase `npm`,
    so a required gate forbidding it reported `pass`. Reporting the command
    as unreadable instead is worse: a Bash call carrying a heredoc of Python
    or SQL is routinely unparseable to shlex, and an `unknown` there blocks
    every ordinary tool call rather than the forbidden ones.

    The whitespace split is deliberately degraded, not equivalent: it cannot
    tell a quoted argument from a bare word, so a forbidden phrase inside a
    quoted string in an already-unparseable command matches where it would
    not have in a parseable one. That trade is the right way round. It costs
    a false positive on a command that was malformed to begin with, and it
    buys back detection on the shape an evasion would actually take.
    Separator normalization degrades the same way here: `_normalize_separators`
    is quote-aware, but a command that reaches this branch has an unbalanced
    quote, which leaves its state machine believing every character from the
    opening quote onward is still inside it, so it pads none of them. This
    branch instead pads unconditionally (`_BLIND_SEPARATOR_PAD`), on the
    original comment-stripped text rather than that already-attempted,
    possibly-incomplete normalization.

    An empty segment (two separators back to back, or one at either end,
    e.g. `";" * n`) is dropped rather than returned: `_contains_subsequence`
    can never match a non-empty forbidden phrase against it (every phrase is
    non-empty by construction, `domain.policy` rejects one that isn't), so
    keeping it around costs a phrase-count's worth of guaranteed-`False`
    comparisons for nothing. A caller-controlled string built from many
    separators and no real content, ";" * 500 against 500 forbidden
    phrases, measured ~25,000,000 such comparisons and ~1.1s before this.

    that passed. An empty list is not absent evidence; see ``scope`` below.

    exactly that against itself). A caller that does run judge gates for
    this event (`Stop`) submits ``JudgeEvidence``, empty or not, and the
