    """A gate that fails when a caller-submitted path matches a forbidden glob.

    ``forbidden`` entries are repo-relative POSIX globs: ``*`` matches within
    one path segment, ``**`` crosses segment boundaries. This is the v0 glob
    grammar; the full symlink/monorepo/rename grammar is AG-005.

    This is the one gate type with a real choice of ``runs``, because a path
    is knowable at three moments that are not interchangeable:

    ``pre_tool_use.edit_target`` is the path a write tool names before it
    runs, so a match refuses the call and the write never happens. It covers
    only tools whose input declares a path (``Edit``/``Write``/
    ``NotebookEdit``, Codex's ``apply_patch``). A ``Bash`` call declares none,
    so **every path a shell command writes is invisible to this source**: a
    redirect, ``sed -i``, a heredoc, ``cp``, a script. Prevention for those
    lives on :class:`CommandGate`, which refuses the command itself.

    ``pre_tool_use.read_target`` is the same thing for ``Read``: the path it
    names before it runs, so a match refuses the call and the file's contents
    never enter the transcript, where they would stay for the rest of the
    session. This is the source a secret rule wants, since "do not read this"
    is the thing such a rule most needs to say. ``Grep`` and ``Glob`` are
    deliberately outside it: they return matching lines and file names rather
    than whole contents, and reading one line through a narrow pattern is the
    mitigation such a gate's own message should recommend.

    ``stop.working_tree`` is what ``git status`` reports once the turn is over.
    It is complete over the tree, whatever wrote the file, and it is always
    after the fact: the gate blocks the turn rather than the write.

    The two prevention sources are **not** symmetric in what backs them up. A
    write that escapes ``pre_tool_use.edit_target`` through the shell is still
    caught by ``stop.working_tree`` afterwards. A read that escapes
    ``pre_tool_use.read_target`` through the shell (``cat``, ``less``,
    ``head``) is caught by nothing, ever, because a read leaves no trace in
    the tree for ``git status`` to find. A rule that cares about shell reads
    needs a :class:`CommandGate` beside this one; naming ``stop.working_tree``
    does not stand in for one.

    Most write rules want both write-side sources, and that is usually right
    even for a path a build generates: "nothing legitimately writes this by
    hand" is exactly when an agent writing it by hand is worth refusing, and
    naming ``pre_tool_use.edit_target`` costs nothing when no tool call ever
    names the path. Drop it only when you positively want such a write allowed
    through to be judged against the finished tree instead.

    keeps ``"npm"`` from matching inside ``"pnpm"``, and ``"--force"`` from

    ``rubric`` is free text describing what the model should check (e.g.
    "Does this change follow the repository's error-handling conventions?").
    Otari itself never calls a model: the caller (``otari hook``) reads
    ``rubric``, builds a prompt from it plus its own diff and transcript, runs
    its own model call, and submits the resulting verdict as
    :class:`JudgeEvidence`. This route only relays that verdict.

    ``enforcement`` is always ``"advisory"``; ``domain/policy.py`` rejects
    ``required`` at parse time, for two independent reasons, either alone
    sufficient. A model's verdict is not reproducible the way a glob or
    phrase match is. And the diff and transcript text a verdict is judged
    from are the same untrusted, attacker-influenceable content a
    prompt-injection attack already targets elsewhere in this codebase (see
    ``services/url_safety.py`` and the MCP tool loop): a crafted diff or
    transcript could talk a model into a ``pass`` it should not give, and
    nothing here can rule that out, since the caller's own prompt
    construction is outside what Otari can see or verify. Advisory
    enforcement is what keeps that from ever mattering: at worst, a
    compromised verdict suppresses a warning, never a block. See
    docs/agent-guardrails.md.

    ``when_changed`` is optional and, like ``CommandIfChangedGate``'s own
    field of the same name, the same repo-relative POSIX glob grammar
    ``PathGate.forbidden`` uses. Empty (the default) means this gate
    always applies, the only behavior a judge gate had before this field
    existed. Non-empty scopes the model call to a session that actually
    touched a matching path, so a rubric about, say, error-handling
    conventions is not re-judged, at real model-call cost, on a session that
    never touched application code.

    ``priority`` orders this gate against the policy's other judge gates
    when more of them apply to one Stop event than the caller will run (see
    :func:`by_priority`). Higher runs first; gates sharing a value keep
    declaration order. It exists so that which judge gates a capped run keeps
    is something a gate says about itself, rather than a consequence of where
    its file happened to sort in a composed policy.

    ``judge_cli`` is optional and names which locally-installed CLI(s)
    ``otari hook`` may use to make the model call this gate needs, in
    preference order; the first one whose own binary is found on ``PATH``
    wins. ``None`` (the default, and the only behavior a judge gate had
    before this field existed) means no preference: the caller falls back to
    whichever CLI its own invoking harness implies (Claude Code's hook ->
    ``claude``, Codex's -> ``codex``). Naming one explicitly is what lets a
    gate authored for, say, a Codex-only fleet require ``codex`` even when
    invoked by a Claude Code hook, or list both so whichever is actually
    installed on a given machine is used. This field changes nothing about

    a closed set of otari-shipped implementations. Otari itself never runs
    it, the same way it never reads a caller's repository for any other gate:
    the caller (``otari hook``) runs the script with ``cwd`` at the repo
    root and submits the resulting verdict as :class:`CheckEvidence`. The
    exit-code contract is fixed and caller-independent: 0 is ``pass``, 1 is
    ``fail``, anything else (including a crash) is ``error``. Captured
    stdout, capped, becomes the verdict's ``detail``.

    Unlike :class:`JudgeGate`, ``enforcement`` is not restricted to
    ``advisory``: a verifier's exit code is reproducible the way a glob or
    phrase match is, not a model's opinion, so a ``required`` verifier
    gate can genuinely block. This is also the first gate type that *runs*
    something the policy names, rather than matching text or prompting a
    model, so its trust boundary is the repo: a script checked into the repo
    and named by that repo's own policy is the same trust level as a
    Makefile target or a pre-commit hook, which is why the caller resolves
    the verifier against the repo root and refuses a path that climbs out.
