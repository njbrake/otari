"""Evaluate a submitted policy against submitted evidence.

The orchestration shared by the Hook Server route (``routes/hooks.py``) and
``otari hook``'s own local evaluation: parse the policy, guard the match-cost
budgets below, dispatch every gate to its evaluator, and fold the results
into one pass/fail verdict. Pure, like every other module in this package:
no filesystem, network, subprocess, or clock access. A caller collects its
own evidence; this only ever computes over what it was given.
