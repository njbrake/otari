"""Prometheus registry, metric types, and HTTP request instrumentation for the gateway.

The metric types are re-exported so that code declaring a metric need not depend
on ``prometheus_client`` directly. That re-export is also what makes the library
an optional extra (``gateway[metrics]``): when it is absent the names below are
no-op stands-in, so every declaration and every increment elsewhere still runs
unguarded. A deployment that does not scrape pays neither the import
(``prometheus_client.exposition`` pulls in ``http.server`` and
``wsgiref.simple_server``, which nothing else here needs) nor the collection, and
one that asks for a scrape (``enable_metrics``) is refused at startup rather than
served an empty body; see ``_validate_metrics_support`` in :mod:`gateway.main`.
