        display_model: When set (the selector, alias, or policy name the caller

            formatting, so the upstream model name never appears on the wire.

            included usage data
        on_error: Called with the raised exception on failure. The exception
            itself, not a message, so the caller can classify it (e.g. record the
            upstream HTTP status on the usage log) as well as render it.

            sent no usage data. Lets the caller bill per ``stream_missing_usage_policy``
            instead of silently skipping the request. When omitted, a no-usage
            stream is not billed (legacy behavior).
        on_incomplete: Called when the stream neither completes nor errors normally
            (e.g. client disconnect mid-stream). Used to release any budget
            reservation so it does not leak.
        keepalive_interval_seconds: Emit ``fmt.keepalive`` whenever the upstream has
            produced nothing for this long, including while terminal settlement is
            pending. 0 disables.
        settle_before_done: Buffer the designated terminal suffix and settle usage
            before emitting it. Standalone callers leave this false.
        is_cost_carrier: Identifies a provider object that can carry cost. The last
            match in the stream wins, so a predicate that also matches a non-terminal
            object (a chat tool loop forwards one usage chunk per iteration) costs no
            buffering beyond the chunks between that match and the next one.
        attach_settlement: Mutates that carrier with the opaque settlement value.
        on_first_chunk: Called synchronously, at most once, the moment the first
            non-keepalive chunk is about to be formatted and yielded. Lets the
            caller record time-to-first-token without this generator knowing

    attempt and an iterator that re-emits the chunk followed by the rest of
    the stream.

    For each attempt:

    1. ``build_stream(attempt)`` is awaited — typically wraps ``acompletion``.
       If it raises, the error is classified, ``on_attempt_failed`` is called
       so the caller can record per-attempt failure metadata (regardless of
       whether the error is retryable), then retryable errors continue to the
       next attempt and non-retryable errors propagate.
    2. The first chunk is awaited under a per-attempt cap. For non-final
       attempts the cap is ``first_chunk_timeout_seconds``, a failover trigger
       that abandons a slow attempt so the next one in the plan is tried. The
       final (or sole) attempt has nothing to fall over to, so it gets
       ``first_chunk_timeout_seconds + final_attempt_extra_seconds``: extra grace
       on top of the failover budget so a slow-but-valid first token still
       streams, while the wait stays bounded (a genuinely hung upstream still
       times out). If the wait times out or the upstream raises before yielding,
       the same classification + ``on_attempt_failed`` logic applies.
    3. Once a first chunk is in hand, we commit — the function returns and
       the caller flushes the response. Errors after this point reach the
       client; they cannot be hidden without buffering the entire stream.

    This is the streaming-mode analogue of the non-streaming retry loop in
    ``chat.py``. The contract is identical: ``on_attempt_failed`` records every
    failed attempt, retryable failures skip-and-continue, non-retryable
    failures propagate immediately, and the last exception is raised if every
    attempt is exhausted with retryable failures.

    Latency contract: zero added latency in the success case — we hold the
    first chunk only long enough to call this function's caller. In the
    failure case, each abandoned non-final attempt costs at most
    ``first_chunk_timeout_seconds``; the final attempt costs at most
    ``first_chunk_timeout_seconds + final_attempt_extra_seconds``.
