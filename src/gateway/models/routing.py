"""Schema for the ``routing:`` config block: named routing policies.

A policy is a named model callers put in the ``model`` field. It decides which
real model serves the request, in what order candidates are tried, and which
guardrails always run. A one-target policy is the same thing as an alias, which
is why ``aliases:`` remains supported as its shorthand.

Two axes, deliberately separate:

* ``select`` decides where the plan *starts*. Entries are evaluated in order and
  the first whose ``when`` matches wins; the ``default`` entry is the
  fallthrough. A ``router`` entry hands ordering to a router backend instead.
* ``on_failure`` is what gets tried *after* a provider failure, in order.

Collapsing them into one list would make "did this entry not apply, or did it
fail?" ambiguous, and that ambiguity would surface in every log line and every
support thread. The names say which axis is which, and ``default`` is explicit
rather than positional so a misordered policy is refused instead of silently
having dead rules.

Every model here sets ``extra="forbid"``. ``GatewayConfig`` itself is
``extra="ignore"`` (a pydantic-settings default that also swallows stray env
vars), so a typo'd key inside a policy would otherwise vanish and the policy
would quietly not do what it says.

Also holds the routing tables.

    guardrails); flattening it into columns would mean a migration per

    The kNN router (:mod:`gateway.services.routing.knn`) retrieves the nearest
    neighbors of an incoming request's task embedding within one user's records
    and votes on the cheapest candidate that is still good enough. One record is
    one example (one prompt), so the vote is over distinct prompts; ``qualities``
    maps each model to its ``[0, 1]`` score for this prompt, keyed on canonical
    ``instance:model`` so a candidate's spelling never decides whether it matches
    (the router canonicalizes what it reads, so older rows keyed on another
    spelling still match). Records are written by the preference-collection flow,
    never by live traffic (passive learning is a fast-follow).

    Vectors are stored as a JSON list of floats for SQLite/PostgreSQL
    portability and scanned linearly in Python. That holds into the low thousands
    of records per user (the ``router_max_records_per_user`` cap); larger pools
    need an indexed vector store.
    ``embedding_model`` tags each row so changing the embedding model invalidates
    stale vectors instead of mixing incomparable spaces.

    Scoped by ``user_id``, which is the identity the request is routed and billed
    under, so one user's examples never steer another's traffic. CASCADE: the
    records are derived training data, worthless once the user is gone.
    ``workspace_id`` narrows that further: the router reads one (user, workspace)
    partition, so a user who holds keys in two workspaces does not have one
    workspace's labels steering the other's traffic.
