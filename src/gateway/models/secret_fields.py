"""Masking credential-shaped entries in a free-form settings dict.

Four tables carry arbitrary operator-supplied JSON that something downstream is
handed as keyword arguments: ``org_provider_keys.client_args``,
``provider_credentials.client_args`` and ``search_tool_credentials.options``,
which reach a provider SDK, and ``organization_guardrails.validate_kwargs``,
which reaches the guardrails service. All four are places a real credential
legitimately lives (standalone Bedrock needs ``aws_secret_access_key`` in
``client_args``, ``services/bedrock_gateway_auth.py`` explains why; a guardrail
class can take its vendor key as a parameter), and none of them may echo one
back over the API. A leaf module rather than a helper on one of the models, so
the later serializers share the first's rules instead of carrying a copy that
drifts.

Masking keys off the entry's *name*, which is what lets it hold for a guardrail
parameter whose catalog entry cannot be read at all: the guardrails service is
what says which parameters are secret, and the mask has to apply while it is
down.

    credential with the mask, which is how the dashboard's provider form saves
    (`web/src/features/providers/ProvidersPage.tsx` renders the stored args into

    so, since the two are the same bytes on the wire. Clearing the entry and
