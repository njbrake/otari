"""Masking credential-shaped entries in a free-form settings dict.

Three tables carry arbitrary operator-supplied JSON that a provider SDK is
handed as keyword arguments: ``org_provider_keys.client_args``,
``provider_credentials.client_args`` and ``search_tool_credentials.options``.
All three are places a real credential legitimately lives (a provider SDK can
take a secret as a client constructor kwarg), and none of them may echo one
back over the API. A leaf module rather than a helper on one of the models, so
the later serializers share the first's rules instead of carrying a copy that
drifts.
