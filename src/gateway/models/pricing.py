class OrganizationModelPricing(Base):
    """One organization's rate for a model, sitting above the deployment price list.

    ``model_pricing`` carries no tenancy column: it is one price list for the
    whole deployment. This table is the layer above it, so an organization can
    price the models it uses at its own negotiated rates while every other
    organization, and every model it has not overridden, keeps resolving exactly
    as before. Resolution order is override, then deployment row, then the
    genai-prices dataset (`services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`).

    **Keyed on ``model_key``, not a split provider and model.** The platform's
    equivalent table (`otari-ai` ``organization_model_pricing``) carries
    ``provider`` and ``model`` as separate columns. Here the whole pricing chain
    keys on one ``provider:model`` string, and that string is not always a
    provider and a model: a pricing key names a provider *instance*
    (``home_lab:llama-3``, over ``provider_type: openai``) and sometimes no model
    at all (``otari:web_search``). Splitting it would make an override
    unmatchable for exactly the keys an operator is most likely to have priced by
    hand, so the override keys the same way the row it overrides does.

    **An interval, where ``model_pricing`` carries a version series.** A price in
    ``model_pricing`` is ``(model_key, effective_at)`` and a later row silently
    shadows an earlier one, which is the right shape for a catalog an operator
    re-imports. An override is a commitment for a period, so it carries both ends
    and overlapping periods for one model are refused rather than shadowed
    (`services.organization_pricing_service`). ``effective_to`` NULL means open
    ended.

    **The overlap rule is enforced in the service, not by the database.** The
    natural constraint is a PostgreSQL ``EXCLUDE`` over a ``tstzrange``, and the
    platform has one. SQLite has no exclusion constraint and no range type, and
    it is what the OSS edition ships by default, so a database-side rule would
    hold on one engine and be a comment on the other. The unique index below is
    what both engines can enforce: it stops the exact-duplicate start, which is
    the collision two concurrent writers actually produce, while a partial
    overlap between two simultaneous inserts remains a narrow race the service's
    check can lose. Single-writer configuration traffic, and a wrong rate is
    visible and correctable rather than silent.

    Rates are the exact ``UsdRate`` type ``ModelPricing`` uses, and the two
    tables carry it together (#661, one migration over both). An override
    resolves *into* a transient ``ModelPricing``, so one implementation of the
    cost math prices both, which it could not if they disagreed about the type
    of money.
