class ModelAlias(Base):
    """A display name that resolves to a real model selector.

    The runtime counterpart of the ``aliases:`` block in config.yml: same
    meaning, but writable through the API. Pricing, budgets, and usage all key
    on the resolved target, so nothing here is billed against ``name``.

    There are two scopes, and they are independent. ``workspace_id`` says which
    tenant owns the alias: it resolves only for requests in that workspace, so
    two workspaces can each point ``fast`` somewhere different. Within a
    workspace, ``user_id`` narrows it further: ``NULL`` means every caller in
    that workspace sees it, which is what every row predating the column is, and
    a non-null ``user_id`` scopes it to that user, shadowing the workspace-wide
    row of the same name for them alone.

    Uniqueness needs two constraints rather than one because SQLite and
    PostgreSQL both treat NULLs as distinct in a unique index: the composite
    constraint keeps one row per (workspace, name, user), and the partial index
    keeps one workspace-wide row per (workspace, name), which the composite one
    cannot, its ``user_id`` being NULL. The surrogate ``id`` exists only because
    the natural key contains a nullable column, which a primary key cannot.
