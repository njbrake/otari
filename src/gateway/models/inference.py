    into ``users.spend``, and ownership can be enforced without depending on the
    provider round-tripping the ``otari_user_id`` metadata marker. Batches created
    before this table existed carry no record and fall back to the
    metadata-anchored ownership path in ``api/routes/batches.py``. ``workspace_id``
    additionally anchors which workspace's organization-scoped provider key
    (otari#643) lifecycle calls should resolve credentials from.
