# The largest token or request limit a route accepts, and the largest hold it
# will place. Well below the BIGINT ceiling those columns are, for the two
# reasons :data:`gateway.models.money.MAX_USD_LIMIT` keeps its own headroom.
#
# The wire cannot carry the type's maximum. JSON numbers are doubles, so
# ``9223372036854775807`` renders in the published schema as
# ``9.223372036854776e+18``, which is 9223372036854775808: a client sending
# exactly the maximum the spec advertises sends a value the column refuses. A
# quadrillion is exact as a double, so the schema says what it means.
#
# And the gate adds server-side. Every reserve evaluates
# ``current + reserved + held`` as BIGINT arithmetic, so a nonzero counter plus a
# hold near the type's ceiling overflows and answers with a 500 where a 403 was
# owed. Holds are clamped to this too, because the token estimate derives from a
# client-supplied output bound that nothing else limits.

    """A spending ceiling on one tenancy scope, optionally narrowed to one provider.

    Two axes. The identity axis is ``(scope_type, scope_id)``: who is capped, an
    organization, a workspace, a member of either, or a single API key. The
    resource axis is ``provider_key_id``: NULL caps spend across every provider,
    a value narrows the cap to one provider instance. A request must pass every
    row that applies to it, and each row is an independent ceiling with its own
    counters and its own period window, unlike ``budgets``, where the window and
    the counters live on the user.

    No limit is stored here. A limit is a property of the budget this names,
    which is the only place in the schema that maps a cap to a figure, on any of
    the three axes it can cap.

    ``scope_type`` is a plain string rather than a database enum so a new scope
    needs no enum migration, and ``scope_id`` is a string so it holds both this
    codebase's string ids (an API key's) and the platform's UUIDs. Nothing here
    is a foreign key for the same reason: the rows a scope names live in four
    different tables, and a provider instance may be configured in ``config.yml``
    and have no row at all.

    A row names a ``budgets`` row and holds the counters for spending it. The
    limit and the period are read through the budget, never copied, so editing a
    budget moves every ceiling that names it. That is deliberate: a budget is a
    named thing an operator hands out, and the alternative was the same figure
    typed once per place it applied.

    This table does not replace ``budgets``, and the two enforce differently. A
    budget reached through ``users.budget_id`` is checked against
    ``users.spend + users.reserved``, so N users sharing one each get the full
    limit. A budget reached through a row here is checked against *this row's*
    counters, so everyone the scope names draws on one allowance. Same budget,

    * **Release becomes idempotent.** Without an identity, a second release for
      the same request silently subtracts the hold twice. ``_release_reserved``
      clamps at zero, so that shows up not as an error but as an under-count of

      exists to provide. The status transition here is what makes only the first

    * **A leaked hold becomes reclaimable individually.** A failure between
      reserve and settle used to leave an amount in the counter that could be
      seen only in aggregate and released by nothing at all: the budget reset
      zeroes ``spend`` and leaves ``reserved`` where it is. With a row it has an
