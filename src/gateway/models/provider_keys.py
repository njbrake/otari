"""Organization-scoped provider keys.

Decided at otari-ai#1748: the platform's ``ProviderKey`` shape
(organization scope, archival, one default per organization+provider,
per-workspace pin/disable overrides, per-workspace model allow-lists) ports
into otari as new, additive tables. ``provider_credentials`` and its
config.yml-merge overlay (``services/provider_store_service.py``) are
unchanged: they stay the mechanism for config.yml-defined and legacy
deployment-global stored credentials, addressed by instance name exactly as
before. These two mechanisms are disjoint by construction (see
``services/provider_kwargs.py``): an ``instance:model`` selector that matches
an existing ``config.providers`` entry never consults these tables, and a
bare ``provider:model`` selector never consults ``config.providers`` for a
workspace that has an org-scoped key. See mozilla-ai/otari#643.

Three tables, named to avoid a collision that already exists in this
codebase: ``ScopedBudget.provider_key_id`` (`models/entities.py`) already
means "an instance-name string, no FK". These tables use ``org_provider_key``
throughout so no column here is ever ambiguously named ``provider_key_id``.

- ``OrgProviderKey`` (``org_provider_keys``): one BYO credential, scoped to an
  organization. otari-ai's ``ProviderKey`` also carries a "managed/phantom"
  bucket (a platform-hosted upstream credential with no stored ``api_key``);
  that concept has no otari-side equivalent (managed credentials are hosted
  depth) and is dropped entirely here, so ``is_org_default`` is one flag per
  ``(organization_id, provider)`` rather than per bucket.
- ``WorkspaceProviderKeyOverride`` (``workspace_provider_key_overrides``): a
  workspace's departure from its organization's default for one key. Absence
  of a row means full inheritance; a row pins the key as this workspace's
  default (``is_default``), opts the workspace out of it (``disabled``), or
  both fields are their default and the row is meaningless (the service layer
  deletes it rather than storing a no-op).
- ``WorkspaceProviderModelRestriction`` (``workspace_provider_model_restrictions``):
  a per-workspace, per-key model allow-list. No rows for a
  ``(workspace, key)`` pair means every model is allowed; one or more rows
  narrows it to exactly those.

Style follows ``models/tenancy.py``: SQLModel (not `entities.py`'s declarative
style) because these are tenancy-scoped tables sharing its mixins and
``UtcDateTime`` timestamp handling, and no ``relationship()`` is declared
(lazy loading raises ``MissingGreenlet`` on an ``AsyncSession``); repositories
join explicitly.

CASCADE, not the ``RESTRICT`` default `AGENTS.md` states for a gateway table
gaining tenancy scope, is deliberate here: these three tables are org- and
workspace-*owned* resources, like ``organization_member``/``workspace_member``
(CASCADE), not durable request-plane history like ``usage_logs``/``api_keys``
(RESTRICT, so a workspace delete cannot silently take budgets or usage with
it). A credential or its overrides have no meaning once the organization or
workspace that owns them is gone.
