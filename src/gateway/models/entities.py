    session credential is ever persisted in JS-readable storage. Sessions
    expire on a TTL and are revoked on sign-out and on master-key rotation.

    ``user_id`` is what lets a session resolve a caller rather than only prove
    that the master key was presented once. It names a tenancy identity
    (`models.tenancy.User`), whose ``active_organization_id`` is the
    organization the session acts in, so a tenancy surface reads its scope off
    the session. Master-key sign-in binds the session to the deployment's
    bootstrap operator; a per-user sign-in flow binds it to whoever
    authenticated.

    NOT NULL on purpose: a session that names nobody cannot answer "who is
    calling", which is the whole point of the column, and the migration that
    added it bound existing sessions to that same bootstrap operator. CASCADE

    Two axes. The identity axis is ``(scope_type, scope_id)``: who is capped, an
    organization, a workspace, a member of either, or a single API key. The
    resource axis is ``provider_key_id``: NULL caps spend across every provider,
    a value narrows the cap to one provider instance. A request must pass every
    row that applies to it, and each row is an independent ceiling with its own
    counters and its own period window, unlike ``budgets``, where the window and
    the counters live on the user.

    No limit is stored here. A limit is a property of the budget this names,
    which is the only place in the schema that maps a cap to a figure, on any of
    the three axes it can cap.

    ``scope_type`` is a plain string rather than a database enum so a new scope
    needs no enum migration, and ``scope_id`` is a string so it holds both this
    codebase's string ids (an API key's) and the platform's UUIDs. Nothing here
    is a foreign key for the same reason: the rows a scope names live in four
    different tables, and a provider instance may be configured in ``config.yml``
    and have no row at all.

    A row names a ``budgets`` row and holds the counters for spending it. The
    limit and the period are read through the budget, never copied, so editing a
    budget moves every ceiling that names it. That is deliberate: a budget is a
    named thing an operator hands out, and the alternative was the same figure
    typed once per place it applied.

    This table does not replace ``budgets``, and the two enforce differently. A
    budget reached through ``users.budget_id`` is checked against
    ``users.spend + users.reserved``, so N users sharing one each get the full
    limit. A budget reached through a row here is checked against *this row's*

    * **Release becomes idempotent.** Without an identity, a second release for
      the same request silently subtracts the hold twice. ``_release_reserved``
      clamps at zero, so that shows up not as an error but as an under-count of
      live holds, which weakens the very overspend guarantee the reserve gate
      exists to provide. The status transition here is what makes only the first
      release do the work.
    * **A leaked hold becomes reclaimable individually.** A failure between
      reserve and settle used to leave an amount in the counter that could be
      seen only in aggregate and released by nothing at all: the budget reset
      zeroes ``spend`` and leaves ``reserved`` where it is. With a row it has an
      owner, an age and a TTL.

    The row is written *after* the holds it records, never before. A hold with no
    row is the pre-existing leak the sweep bounds; a row with no hold would have
    the sweep release an amount nobody holds, under-counting the live ones. Of
    the two inconsistent windows only one is safe, and this is it.

    Standalone mode only: hybrid mode reserves nothing locally, because the
    platform holds against its own ledger.

class OrganizationModelPricing(Base):
    """One organization's rate for a model, sitting above the deployment price list.

    ``model_pricing`` carries no tenancy column: it is one price list for the
    whole deployment. This table is the layer above it, so an organization can
    price the models it uses at its own negotiated rates while every other
    organization, and every model it has not overridden, keeps resolving exactly
    as before. Resolution order is override, then deployment row, then the
    genai-prices dataset (`services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`).

    **Keyed on ``model_key``, not a split provider and model.** The platform's
    equivalent table (`otari-ai` ``organization_model_pricing``) carries
    ``provider`` and ``model`` as separate columns. Here the whole pricing chain
    keys on one ``provider:model`` string, and that string is not always a
    provider and a model: a pricing key names a provider *instance*
    (``home_lab:llama-3``, over ``provider_type: openai``) and sometimes no model
    at all (``otari:web_search``). Splitting it would make an override
    unmatchable for exactly the keys an operator is most likely to have priced by
    hand, so the override keys the same way the row it overrides does.

    **An interval, where ``model_pricing`` carries a version series.** A price in
    ``model_pricing`` is ``(model_key, effective_at)`` and a later row silently
    shadows an earlier one, which is the right shape for a catalog an operator
    re-imports. An override is a commitment for a period, so it carries both ends
    and overlapping periods for one model are refused rather than shadowed
    (`services.organization_pricing_service`). ``effective_to`` NULL means open
    ended.

    **The overlap rule is enforced in the service, not by the database.** The
    natural constraint is a PostgreSQL ``EXCLUDE`` over a ``tstzrange``, and the
    platform has one. SQLite has no exclusion constraint and no range type, and
    it is what the OSS edition ships by default, so a database-side rule would
    hold on one engine and be a comment on the other. The unique index below is
    what both engines can enforce: it stops the exact-duplicate start, which is
    the collision two concurrent writers actually produce, while a partial
    overlap between two simultaneous inserts remains a narrow race the service's
    check can lose. Single-writer configuration traffic, and a wrong rate is
    visible and correctable rather than silent.

    Rates are the exact ``UsdRate`` type ``ModelPricing`` uses, and the two
    tables carry it together (#661, one migration over both). An override
    resolves *into* a transient ``ModelPricing``, so one implementation of the
    cost math prices both, which it could not if they disagreed about the type

    ``workspace_id`` is the primary key: a workspace has one policy or none,
    so there is nothing else to identify a row by. It is a real foreign key

    the row, so it rides the workspace's own delete.

    ``image`` may only name something the deployment's operator has already
    curated into ``sandbox_allowed_session_images``, so a workspace picks from an
    operator's shelf rather than pointing the gateway at an image of its own,

    The plane *above* the deployment-wide guardrail settings, not a replacement
    for them: ``guardrails_url`` stays in ``runtime_settings`` and a deployment
    that configures no organization guardrails behaves exactly as it did
    (otari#654). A row here is a check the organization mandates; it is merged
    into the effective guardrail list at admission by ``prepare_gateway_tools``
    the same way a routing policy's mandate already is, so an organization can
    only ever add a check or tighten one a caller asked for.

    That is what keeps this inside the rule ``src/gateway/AGENTS.md`` records
    from #655/#678: a mandated guardrail can only make *fewer* requests succeed,
    never more, whichever endpoint it names. Which is also why the entry may
    carry its own ``url`` and credential where a workspace code-execution policy
    may not: the sandbox is a capability a workspace would be acquiring, and a
    guardrail is a restriction the organization is accepting. A caller can
    already point a request-body guardrail at a URL of their own
    (``models/guardrails.GuardrailConfig.url``, SSRF-checked on the request
    path), so storing one here grants nothing that was not already reachable.

    ``profile`` is unique per organization rather than a nickname being unique,
    which is where this parts company with the hosted
    ``organization_guardrail_key`` (unique on ``(organization_id, nickname)``,
    so one profile may be configured twice). The effective guardrail set on this
    request path is keyed by profile, because ``merge_guardrail_layers`` has
    always merged that way; two rows of one profile could therefore never both
    run, and one would silently win.
