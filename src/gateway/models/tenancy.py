"""Tenancy: organizations, workspaces, and the identities that belong to them.

The reconciled control plane's tenancy core, rehomed from the platform
(`otari-ai` `backend/app/models/`) as part of the M5 strangle. Five tables, one
graph: an ``organization`` owns ``workspace`` rows, and ``user`` rows join both
through ``organization_member`` and ``workspace_member``.

**Why SQLModel here and plain SQLAlchemy in `entities.py`.** SQLModel is
SQLAlchemy underneath, so these classes bind to the gateway's ``AsyncSession``
unchanged while keeping the ``Create``/``Update``/``Public`` schema layer the
routes and the generated dashboard client are built on. Converting them to
`entities.py`'s declarative style would have rewritten every endpoint contract
in the slice for no behavioral gain. `entities.py` stays as it is: the two
styles coexist deliberately, and new *gateway* tables still belong there.

**One MetaData, two styles.** `entities.py`'s ``Base`` shares
``SQLModel.metadata`` (see the note there), so Alembic, ``create_all`` and
``drop_all`` see one schema no matter which style declared a table.

Three deliberate departures from the platform's models, applied on arrival:

- **Timestamps are timezone-aware, on every engine.** The platform's mixins
  annotate ``created_at``/``updated_at`` as a bare ``datetime`` (so SQLAlchemy
  renders a naive column) while their ``default_factory`` writes an aware
  ``datetime.now(UTC)`` into it: the offset is silently dropped on the way in,
  and the value reads back as local-looking UTC. That is a latent bug, not a
  style difference, so it is fixed here rather than carried. ``timezone=True``
  alone does not fix it, which is why ``UtcDateTime`` below exists: PostgreSQL
  honors the flag and SQLite ignores it, and SQLite is what the OSS edition
  ships by default, so on that engine the departure would have been a comment
  rather than a behavior. ``tests/unit/test_tenancy_timestamps.py`` is what
  keeps it one.
- **``email`` is a plain nullable string, not ``EmailStr``.** A standalone
  operator identity is a label, not a sign-in address ("local identities have no
  email"), and every reader here must already tolerate its absence, so
  the annotation says so rather than being widened at each call site.
- **Hosted-only columns are not carried, with one exception.** The reconciled
  schema is edition-invariant (the overlay contributes adapters and routers,
  never tables), so a column the hosted edition needs has to live here or
  nowhere. ``workspace.activation_classification`` and
  ``user.default_organization_id`` therefore stay, neither of them read by
  anything in this edition. The identity columns
  (``hashed_password``, ``oauth_provider``, ``email_verification_token``,
  ``email_verified_at``, ``terms_accepted_at``) were held back while
  otari-ai#1716 was open and now join them: that issue settled that the master
  key stays the API credential while sessions become the dashboard login, which
  gives otari-ai#1644 one target schema instead of two. Two of them are read in
  this edition: ``hashed_password`` backs the dashboard password sign-in and
  ``email_verified_at`` is stamped when an operator claims a deployment
  (`gateway.services.tenancy.user_service`). ``oauth_provider`` and
  ``email_verification_token`` are still carried for the hosted edition alone.
  Purely hosted CRM and onboarding columns are the third case and are simply
  not part of the reconciled schema.

No ORM ``relationship()`` is declared on purpose. Lazy loading on an
``AsyncSession`` raises ``MissingGreenlet`` at the point of attribute access
rather than at the query, so this slice joins explicitly in its repositories,
exactly as the platform's own tenancy models do.

    registered under one ID is unusable under another and asking its
    authenticator for it under a different one gets nothing back. Recording the
    ID the row was made under is what lets this deployment say so: a credential
    whose ``rp_id`` is not the one currently configured is filtered out of the
    ceremonies rather than offered and then failing in the browser with a
    ``SecurityError`` nothing on the server can explain.

    It is also the column that carries mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716's standing
    constraint. Migrating otari.ai users import their credentials rather than
    claiming new accounts, and an imported row's ``rp_id`` is ``otari.ai``. That
    import therefore holds exactly while the hosted origin stays ``otari.ai``:
    moving it re-scopes every passkey and no amount of data migration recovers
    them, because the key material never left the authenticator. See
    `docs/access-control.md`.

    ``credential_id`` and ``public_key`` are base64url text rather than
    ``LargeBinary``. Both cross the wire in that encoding in every WebAuthn
    payload, the import above arrives in it, and it reads the same on SQLite and
    PostgreSQL, where a bytes column does not (``BLOB`` versus ``BYTEA``, with
    drivers differing on what comes back). Unique on ``credential_id`` alone,
    not per user: a credential ID that resolved to two identities would make
    a usernameless sign-in ambiguous, which is the one thing that flow cannot
    tolerate.

    ``sign_count`` is the authenticator's own monotonic counter, updated on each
    assertion. Not every authenticator keeps one (a platform passkey synced
    across devices reports 0 forever), so it is recorded and compared but a
    non-increase is not by itself proof of a clone; see
    `services.webauthn_service` for what is actually done with it.
