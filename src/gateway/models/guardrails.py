"""Request-body model for the gateway-managed ``guardrails`` field.

Guardrails are *not* a model-callable tool. Unlike ``otari_code_execution`` /
``otari_web_search`` (which the model decides to invoke inside the tool-use
loop), a guardrail is a request-level policy the **caller** opts into: it runs
on the request regardless of what the model decides, and the model never sees
it. So it lives in its own top-level ``guardrails`` field — modelled like
``mcp_servers`` (see :mod:`gateway.models.mcp`) — rather than inside ``tools``.

The gateway extracts this field, runs the configured checks against the
operator-controlled guardrails service (``otari-anyguardrails-container``,
which exposes ``POST /validate``), and strips the field before forwarding the
request upstream. Omit the field entirely → no guardrail runs.

Also holds the organization guardrail tables.

    construct it with. So an organization can define a check rather than only
    name a profile some other service already serves.

    A table of its own rather than three more columns on the mandate, because
    the two have different keys. A mandate is identified by
    ``(organization_id, profile)`` and also carries ``mode``,
    ``on_unavailable`` and the workspace scope; the build arguments depend on
    ``guardrail_name`` alone. Fused, one guardrail placed under two policies
    would hold two copies of the same vendor key, take two writes to rotate it,
    and build the same vendor client twice per worker, and "configured but not
    mandated yet" would have nowhere to live. Fusing the two later is
    denormalizing; splitting them later needs a migration that dedupes N
    possibly-divergent copies with no safe automatic answer, and that asymmetry
    is what settles it.

    could not be reached from ``HOSTED_SURFACES`` at all (#818).

    The plane *above* the deployment-wide guardrail settings, not a replacement
    for them: ``guardrails_url`` stays in ``runtime_settings`` and a deployment
    that configures no organization guardrails behaves exactly as it did
    (otari#654). A row here is a check the organization mandates; it is merged
    into the effective guardrail list at admission by ``prepare_gateway_tools``
    the same way a routing policy's mandate already is, so an organization can
    only ever add a check or tighten one a caller asked for.

    That is what keeps this inside the rule ``src/gateway/AGENTS.md`` records
    from #655/#678: a mandated guardrail can only make *fewer* requests succeed,
    never more, whichever endpoint it names. Which is also why the entry may
    carry its own ``url`` and credential where a workspace code-execution policy
    may not: the sandbox is a capability a workspace would be acquiring, and a
    guardrail is a restriction the organization is accepting. A caller can
    already point a request-body guardrail at a URL of their own
    (``models/guardrails.GuardrailConfig.url``, SSRF-checked on the request
    path), so storing one here grants nothing that was not already reachable.

    ``profile`` is unique per organization rather than a nickname being unique,
    which is where this parts company with the hosted
    ``organization_guardrail_key`` (unique on ``(organization_id, nickname)``,
    so one profile may be configured twice). The effective guardrail set on this
