"""Playground: the dashboard's own chat surface, and what it may remember.

The Playground is the in-product chat page: pick a model this gateway can
route to, talk to it, compare two models side by side, and keep the exchanges
worth keeping. otari-ai#1947 asked for it back after the hosted original was
retired (otari-ai#1920), and otari#663 is the port; njbrake settled that it
lives in the OSS build rather than the overlay.

Five tables, and none of them is on the request path. A completion runs through
the ordinary pipeline and writes the ordinary ``usage_logs`` row; these hold
only what the *page* remembers between visits, for the one identity that wrote
it:

- ``playground_consent``: whether this person has agreed to content retention
  at all, split by what is retained. No row means not agreed, which is why the
  read side defaults rather than provisions.
- ``playground_conversation`` + ``playground_message``: a saved single-panel
  transcript, resumable.
- ``playground_comparison``: one rated A/B exchange, a point-in-time judgment
  rather than something to resume.
- ``playground_favorite_model``: the model keys this person pins to the top of
  every picker, per workspace, so the pin follows them off this browser.

**Owned by the tenancy identity, not by the attribution user.** Every row here
keys on ``user.id`` (the uuid a dashboard session names) and not on
``users.user_id`` (the string spend row a completion is billed to). They are the
same person in this deployment, and deliberately not the same lifecycle: the
spend row is *soft*-deleted so past usage keeps a subject to point at
(``DELETE /api/v1/users`` revokes it and leaves the ledger intact), while this
content has no such duty and should leave with the account. CASCADE from
``user.id`` is what makes deleting an identity actually delete what it wrote.

CASCADE from ``workspace.id`` for the same reason ``models/provider_keys.py``
gives: these are workspace-*owned* rows, not durable request-plane history, so
they have no meaning once the workspace is gone. A transcript is not a usage
record; the usage record is the ``usage_logs`` row the completion already wrote,
and that one still keeps its RESTRICT.

**Content columns are ``Text``, and nothing here is encrypted.** A stored
transcript is the prompt and the reply, which the page already showed the person
who wrote it, and which ``usage_logs`` does not hold. Encrypting it would buy
nothing this deployment's threat model asks for (the reader is the row's own
owner, and every route below carries that predicate) while making the rows
unreadable to the operator who backs them up. Secrets that *are* encrypted here
are credentials, and none of these tables holds one.

Style follows ``models/tenancy.py`` and ``models/provider_keys.py``: SQLModel
rather than the declarative ``Base`` style, because the ``Public`` schemas
below are the endpoint contracts the generated dashboard client is built from,
and no ``relationship()`` is declared (lazy loading raises ``MissingGreenlet``
on an ``AsyncSession``), so the routes join explicitly.
