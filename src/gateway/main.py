# body is the caller's whole credential, and it is not one of the header/cookie
# schemes this stamps everything else with). Matched exactly rather than by
# prefix, unlike the two tuples above: a prefix would exempt any future route
# mounted under it too, by inheritance rather than by decision (an operator-only
# resend or list-pending endpoint, say; `/api/v1/auth/session` and
# `/api/v1/auth/password` both live under `/api/v1/auth` and do require a credential),
# and `/api/v1/auth/password/reset` is already a prefix of
# `/api/v1/auth/password/reset/confirm`, so the inheritance is not hypothetical.
# Listed separately from _PUBLIC_PREFIXES because these still get
# the no-store cache headers: each answer is specific to the caller or the
# request's own token, and bootstrap's changes with the deployment's
# configuration, so a shared cache must not serve any of them to a different
# caller/gateway.
# Paths a gateway calls on another gateway, authenticated by the deployment's own
