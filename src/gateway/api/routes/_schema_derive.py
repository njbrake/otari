"""Derive request schemas from any-llm's typed ``*Params`` models.

The gateway forwards declared request fields to any-llm's ``acompletion`` /
``aresponses`` / ``amessages`` / ... calls. Hand-maintaining each request schema
let it drift from the param surface any-llm actually accepts, silently dropping
params before the provider call (this is how ``reasoning_effort`` and nine other
chat params ended up being ignored, mozilla-ai/otari#150, #152).

Deriving the request schema's field set from the matching any-llm ``*Params``
model removes that drift structurally: a derived schema cannot omit a param
any-llm understands, and a new any-llm param is picked up automatically.

Usage: build a base with :func:`derive_request_base`, then subclass it to layer
on gateway-internal fields (``mcp_servers``, ``guardrails``, ...), tighten a
field (a validator, ``min_length``), or replace an any-llm annotation that is
unwieldy for a JSON request body (e.g. the Responses ``input`` union, or
``response_format``'s ``type`` member). A subclass field redefinition fully
overrides the derived one, so the OpenAPI schema reflects the override.

# a caller override an operator-controlled value: the provider-call merge spreads
# request fields last (e.g. ``{**get_provider_kwargs(...), **request_fields}``),
# so a client value would win. The gateway resolves these itself (from ``config``
# / the platform service), so they must never be derived onto a public request
# schema, and they are also stripped before forwarding (see
