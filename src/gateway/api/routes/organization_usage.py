"""The caller's own organization's usage, for a tenant who does not operate the deployment.

``/api/v1/usage`` is deployment-wide and has been operator-only since #821, which
was right: it reads every tenant's rows and its ``workspace_id`` parameter is a
filter the client supplies, so nothing but the operator gate stands between a
signed-in member and another organization's traffic. On a deployment serving
mutually-untrusting tenants that left "show me my organization's usage", the
ordinary case, with no endpoint a member is allowed to call at all
(mozilla-ai/otari#837).

The answer is not a looser gate on that router. A mode that widened
``/api/v1/usage`` for a non-operator would inherit its client-supplied
``workspace_id`` and rebuild the escalation #821 closed. So the deployment-wide
routes keep the gate they have, unchanged, and this router is a second, narrower
reading of the same rows:

* **Scope is derived, never accepted.** It comes from the caller's own
  ``active_organization_id`` by way of ``resolve_visible_workspace_scope``,
  which refuses a pointer with no live membership behind it. No request here
  names an organization. Moving between organizations is
  ``POST /api/v1/organizations/me/switch``, which 404s on one the caller does not
  belong to.
* **How much of the organization** follows the rule the workspace list already
  uses: an owner, an admin or a superuser reads every workspace in it, and a
  member or viewer reads the ones they actively belong to. A member who belongs
  to no workspace gets an empty page, not a refusal: the surface is theirs and
  simply has nothing in it yet.
* **Whose requests** follows the same split: an owner, an admin or a superuser
  reads everyone's, and a member or viewer reads only the rows billed to them
  (``users.user_id`` is their identity's id, the row their own keys bill
  through), even in a workspace they share with other people.
* **``workspace_id`` still narrows, and cannot widen.** It is put through
  ``resolve_workspace_in_organization``, the same resolver every other
  workspace-scoped read uses, so a workspace outside the caller's scope answers
  404 exactly as a workspace that does not exist does.

Reads only. Deleting rows and repricing them stay deployment-wide, as does
``/api/v1/usage/in-flight``: its registry entries carry no workspace at all
(see ``usage.list_in_flight``), so there is nothing there to scope yet.

Every aggregation is the one ``usage.py`` already runs. This module contributes
route declarations and a scope predicate, and nothing that could compute a
different answer to the same question.
