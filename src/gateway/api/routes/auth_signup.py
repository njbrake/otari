"""Signup, email verification, and resending a verification link (standalone mode only).

Deliberately public, the same reasoning ``invitations.py`` gives its two
routes: the person completing signup or opening a verification link holds no
master key and no session yet, and the token or address in the request is
their whole proof of anything here.

What signup may do depends on ``open_signup``. Off, the default, it only ever
claims an identity ``organization_service`` already put on the roster (an admin
added or invited the address) and creates nothing from nothing. On, an address
nobody has added is registered instead, with an organization of its own. See
``user_service.create_user_for_signup``'s own docstring for both.

Either way it is enumeration-safe the same way resend and reset-request are: the
response never says whether the address was unknown, already claimed, or
genuinely just claimed.
