"""Shared glue for running the content normalizer from the request routes.

Resolves the target model's multimodal capabilities and rewrites file/image
content blocks in place — passthrough for natively-capable providers, extract to
text for text-only models. Used by the Chat-Completions, Anthropic Messages, and
OpenAI Responses endpoints so all three get identical handling.

Only the standalone path calls this: hybrid mode routes to frontier providers
that natively understand documents/images (passthrough is already correct) and
has no local DB / file store to resolve ``file_id`` references against.
