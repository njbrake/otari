"""Deployment-wide account administration (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over `gateway.services.tenancy.deployment_user_service`, which
carries the whole of the reasoning: who counts as an operator, why a refusal is a
404, and which two changes are guarded against locking a deployment out of
itself.

The one prefix in the management API that is scoped to the *deployment* rather
than to an organization or a workspace, which is what it is for: every other
identity surface reads through a membership and so cannot see an account whose
memberships are all suspended. It is standalone-only like the rest of the
management plane; a hybrid gateway's accounts live on otari.ai.
