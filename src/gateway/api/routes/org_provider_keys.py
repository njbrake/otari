"""Organization-scoped provider keys (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over `gateway.services.tenancy.org_provider_key_service`.
Two routers, because the surface has two scopes: an organization's own keys
(created, archived, defaulted) under ``/api/v1/organizations/me/provider-keys`,
matching `organizations.py`'s ``/me`` convention, and one workspace's view of
those keys (override, model-restrict) under
``/api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/provider-keys``, matching `workspaces.py`'s
path-scoped convention. A caller manages several workspaces in one
organization, so the workspace surface takes ``workspace_id`` as a path
parameter the way `workspaces.py` does, unlike the organization surface's
``/me``.
