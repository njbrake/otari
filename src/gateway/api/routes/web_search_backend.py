"""The SearXNG-shaped search backend a data-plane gateway calls.

Served by a deployment that holds a licensed search key and runs its inference
somewhere else, which is what a hosted control plane is: the gateway has no
credential and must not be given one, so it sends the query here and this
process makes the provider call. Standalone deployments need none of this and
call :mod:`gateway.services.web_search_providers` in-process instead; the two
share that module, so both surfaces answer a query the same way.

The contract is the one ``WebSearchBackend`` already speaks to a SearXNG
container, so the client side is one setting: a hybrid gateway's
``web_search_url`` pointed at ``{control-plane}/api/v1/web-search``. It has to be
that host and path, under the gateway's own ``PLATFORM_BASE_URL``, because
``url_targets_platform`` is what decides whether the platform token is forwarded
at all, and that token is the credential below. A standalone gateway forwards no
such token and cannot call this; it configures a provider of its own.

**Authenticated, and only mounted when it can be.** The route spends the
deployment's own search quota, and a control plane is internet-reachable, so it
requires ``X-Gateway-Token`` to match the configured ``web_search_backend_token``.
That is the deployment's own data-plane gateway and nothing else: a gateway
someone self-hosts presents a credential of its own, and serving it here would
put a deployment-owned credential's *use* behind a caller the managed-key
boundary keeps it from ever holding. Nothing returned here is a credential; the
response carries public search results.

The query travels in the request target, as it does to a SearXNG container,
because that is the contract ``WebSearchBackend`` speaks. A deployment whose
access log records request targets therefore records search queries; a control
plane that must not keep them turns that log off or redacts this path.
