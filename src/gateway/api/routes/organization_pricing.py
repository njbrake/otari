"""The caller's organization's model rate overrides (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over `gateway.services.organization_pricing_service`: resolve
the caller's identity, call the service, return its typed result. The overlap
rule, the role gate, and the refusal to re-price a model the deployment supplies
the credential for all live there, and the domain errors it raises carry their
own statuses (see `gateway.exceptions.pricing_exceptions`), so nothing here
catches them.

Scoped to ``/me`` for the same reason `routes/organizations.py` is: a request
cannot name an organization at all, because a standalone deployment has exactly
one and the caller's identity already points at it. Multi-organization
administration is the overlay's to contribute.

These rates sit *above* ``/api/v1/pricing``, which stays the deployment price list.
A model with no override here prices exactly as it did before, and the resolution
order (override, deployment row, genai-prices dataset) is
`services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`.
