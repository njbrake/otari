"""The dashboard's first-request setup guide (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over
`gateway.services.tenancy.workspace_activation_service`, following
`routes/workspaces.py`'s shape (master key or a dashboard session on the router,
plus the caller's tenancy identity for the per-workspace role checks). Its own
module rather than three more handlers on `routes/workspaces.py`, matching
`routes/workspace_member_budget_policies.py`: a sub-resource of a workspace with
its own service gets its own file.

The platform's equivalent lives on the same paths
(`otari-ai` `backend/app/api/routes/workspaces.py`), with one rename. Minting
the key is ``POST .../activation/key`` here and ``.../activation/presentation``
there, because the platform stores the key's plaintext (encrypted) and re-shows
the *same* key for one browser session, which is what the presentation id in its
body identifies. Nothing here stores a plaintext, so there is no presentation to
identify: the call issues a key and rotates the previous one.
