"""The caller's organization's guardrails (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over `gateway.services.tenancy.organization_guardrail_service`:
resolve the caller's identity, call the service, return its typed result. The
role gate and the scope rules live there, and the domain errors it raises carry
their own statuses (see `gateway.exceptions.guardrails_exceptions`), so nothing
here catches them.

Scoped to ``/me`` for the reason `routes/organization_pricing.py` and
`routes/organizations.py` are: a standalone deployment has exactly one
organization and the caller's identity already points at it, so a request cannot
name one. Multi-organization administration is the overlay's to contribute.

These entries sit *above* ``/api/v1/tool-settings``, which stays the deployment's own
guardrail configuration. ``guardrails_url`` there is still what a guardrail
without an endpoint of its own is sent to, and an organization with no entries
changes nothing about how a request is checked.
