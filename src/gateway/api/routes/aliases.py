"""Runtime model alias management.

An alias is a display name that resolves to a real ``provider:model`` selector.
``config.yml`` aliases are read-only here (they are validated at startup and
live in a file this process does not own); these routes manage the
``model_aliases`` table, which means the same thing to a request but can change
without a restart.

A stored alias belongs to one workspace, and within it is either workspace-wide
(``user_id`` omitted) or scoped to one user, who is then the only caller in that
workspace that resolves it. A ``config.yml`` alias has no workspace and is in
force in all of them. See ``services/alias_service`` for the precedence between
the layers.

Every verb here takes an optional ``workspace_id``; omitting it means the
deployment's default workspace, which is where an operator acting deployment-wide
writes and where every row predating workspace scoping was backfilled. A
single-workspace deployment therefore never has to name one.
