"""Read and purge endpoints for captured coding-agent telemetry.

Captured telemetry is two kinds of content-free, non-billable record:
behavioral events (tool results, decisions, prompts, errors) and outcome-metric
points (lines changed, commits, pull requests, active time). Neither is worth
much on its own; joined against recorded spend they answer "what did this cost
per unit of work", which is what `/summary` computes.

The telemetry half of every query here goes through `TelemetryStoragePort`, so
these endpoints read whatever store this build bound. The spend half does not:
`usage_logs` is the money path and stays in this deployment's database in every
build, queried inline with SQLAlchemy core against the ORM-mapped class, the way
`usage.py` does, so the route layer stays free of `sqlalchemy.orm`. Joining the
two is this module's job, which is why the arithmetic sits here and not behind
the port.
