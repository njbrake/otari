"""The name a signed-in identity goes by, which is the one thing about itself it can change.

``PATCH /api/v1/auth/profile`` always acts on the caller's own identity: it takes
no id, and an operator changing somebody else's name belongs to the deployment
administration surface rather than here.

It sits beside the password and passkey routes because it answers the same
question they do, "what may the signed-in identity change about itself", and it
is what the account page was missing. ``full_name`` is published on the
membership context so the sidebar can draw a person rather than a role
(mozilla-ai/otari#832), and an identity added to a roster by address carries
none until somebody supplies one; without this there was nowhere to.

The address is deliberately not editable here. Changing a sign-in address is a
credential change with a verification flow behind it, and
``PUT /api/v1/auth/password`` already refuses one
(``EmailChangeNotSupportedError``); this endpoint would be the wrong place to
open that door quietly.
