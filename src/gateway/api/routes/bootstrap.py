"""Deployment bootstrap the dashboard shell reads before it renders.

One server-derived payload that selects the runtime context: which deployment is
serving this URL, what kind of session it issues, which management surfaces it
offers, and, for a hybrid gateway, where its control plane actually lives. The
shell reads it once and gates navigation on it, so no page component has to ask
which mode the gateway is in.

Registered in both modes, and unauthenticated by necessity: this is what tells a
browser whether a sign-in screen is even the right thing to show. It therefore
carries no secret. In particular it never carries the platform token, and
``management_url``, ``data_plane_url``, ``docs_url``, ``terms_url``,
``privacy_url`` and ``site_url`` are addresses an operator configured, not
credentials.

The contract is shared with otari.ai, which serves the same shape for its hosted
deployment (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1591). ``deployment_type`` and ``session_type``
name three values each, and this server produces all three of the first and two
of the second: ``hosted_user`` is a session minted by somebody else's account
system, which no build here does. The enum is the contract, not this
deployment's inventory.

    Three independent questions, and every method here is published only when it
    could actually answer.

    ``master_key`` is the first-boot credential, and it is offered until the
    operator identity holds a password (otari#702), which is what claiming the
    deployment means. Past that point ``POST /api/v1/auth/session`` refuses it
    with a 403, so offering it would be offering a refusal.

    ``password`` is offered while some active identity holds one. Not the
    operator's alone (otari-ai#2100): that endpoint verifies a password against
    whichever identity the address resolves to and has never consulted the
    operator's row, so a member who signed up on a deployment its operator never
    claimed can sign in, and used to be shown the master-key box instead of the
    form that would have worked. The two typed credentials are therefore
    additive rather than exclusive, and an unclaimed deployment with members on
    it publishes both.

    ``passkey`` is the third, additive for a different reason:
    ``POST /api/v1/auth/webauthn/authenticate`` is a separate endpoint that
    displaces neither. It needs the deployment to have a relying-party ID *and*
    to hold at least one credential registered under it, or the button's only
    outcome is the browser reporting that it found nothing.

    A database failure answers "none" rather than propagating. This route is the
    first thing the dashboard shell fetches, so a 500 here is a blank page
    instead of a login screen, and it would be a blank page for the one outage
    where an operator most wants the dashboard to say something. "None" is also
    the truth while the database is unreachable: no session can be minted either
    way, since minting one writes a row.
