"""Deployment bootstrap the dashboard shell reads before it renders.

One server-derived payload that selects the runtime context: which deployment is
serving this URL, what kind of session it issues, which management surfaces it
offers, and, for a hybrid gateway, where its control plane actually lives. The
shell reads it once and gates navigation on it, so no page component has to ask
which mode the gateway is in.

Registered in both modes, and unauthenticated by necessity: this is what tells a
browser whether a sign-in screen is even the right thing to show. It therefore
carries no secret. In particular it never carries the platform token, and
``management_url``, ``data_plane_url``, ``docs_url``, ``terms_url`` and
``privacy_url`` are addresses an operator configured, not credentials.

The contract is shared with otari.ai, which serves the same shape for its hosted
deployment (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1591). ``deployment_type`` and ``session_type``
name three values each, and this server produces all three of the first and two
of the second: ``hosted_user`` is a session minted by somebody else's account
system, which no build here does. The enum is the contract, not this
deployment's inventory.

# credentials at all.
#
# ``providers`` drops. It is the deployment-instance surface over
# ``provider_credentials``, whose primary key is the instance name alone, so an
# instance added there is served to every organization and shadows that
# organization's own BYO key for the provider (#818). On the single-tenant
# product that page is correct, and it stays; on a multi-tenant one it is a
# control whose blast radius nobody looking at it can see.
#
# ``organization_providers`` appears, and is the per-tenant surface that
# replaces it: ``/api/v1/organizations/me/provider-keys``, the organization-scoped
# BYO keys #670 shipped. It is the one name here that is not its router's path
# prefix, because the router is nested under ``organizations``; ``organizations``
# stays a separate surface, since the roster and the credential set are
# different pages with different access.
#
# Dropping the surface is not itself a guard over the table: ``config.yml``'s
# ``providers:`` block and ``/api/v1/provider-credentials`` still populate it with no
# page in front of them, which is #818's to close.
#
# ``organization_usage`` appears for a different reason: not a credential's
# ownership but a question that only exists once tenants do. The router behind it
# (``/api/v1/organizations/me/usage``) is mounted on both editions, but on standalone
# the organization is the deployment and ``/usage`` already answers it whole, so
# the dashboard's organization-wide Usage page is a destination only where "my
# organization" is narrower than "everything" (otari-ai#1963).
# ``playground`` drops for the third reason, which is not about credentials or
# tenancy at all: a hosted control plane serves no inference (otari#822), so the
# page's whole point is missing rather than its scope being wrong. Its prefix is
# in ``hosted_mode.DATA_PLANE_PREFIXES``, so a browser that reaches the URL

    operator identity holds a password (otari#702), which is what claiming the

    ``password`` is offered while some active identity holds one. Not the

    claimed can sign in, and used to be shown the master-key box instead of the
    form that would have worked. The two typed credentials are therefore

    it publishes both.
