"""Helpers for extracting gateway-managed tools from a request payload.

These helpers are format-agnostic — they only look at the `type` string on
each tool entry. The same predicates and extractors are used from the
Chat-Completions, Anthropic Messages, and OpenAI Responses endpoints so
``otari_code_execution`` / ``otari_web_search`` requests get identical
handling regardless of wire shape.

The explicit ``otari_*`` tool types always trigger gateway-side execution.
A provider-native web-search keyword (``web_search`` / ``web_search_<date>``)
is forwarded to the upstream provider unless ``web_search_intercept`` is on or
:data:`WEB_SEARCH_HEADER` asks otherwise. The header takes ``CodeExecutor``'s
vocabulary: ``auto`` claims the keyword only when a provider in the chain cannot
run it (Anthropic's dated keyword on Messages, OpenAI's on Responses are the
native pairings), ``otari`` always, ``provider`` never, and none of them can
undo interception. Interception is off by default because turning it on
silently takes a search away from a provider that would have run it (see
``docs/tools.md``). An OpenAI ``function`` named ``web_search`` is deliberately
*not* claimed even then: that is a caller's own tool, and hijacking it means the
caller's handler never fires and it never gets back a ``tool_call`` it can
dispatch.

A provider-native code-execution keyword (``code_execution``,
``code_interpreter``, ``code_execution_<date>``) is decided by the request's
**executor** instead (:class:`gateway.models.tools.CodeExecutor`): the
provider, Otari's sandbox, or ``auto``, which picks the provider only when it
runs that tool natively for the dispatched model. ``auto`` is the default, and
it is what lets a request written against a frontier model's own sandbox keep
working when the model is swapped for one that has none. The deployment sets
the default, a workspace policy may pin a value, and :data:`CODE_EXECUTION_HEADER`
chooses per request where the workspace has not.
