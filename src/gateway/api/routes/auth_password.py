"""Setting and changing the password a dashboard sign-in uses.

One endpoint, ``PUT /api/v1/auth/password``, and it always acts on the caller's own
identity. There is deliberately no way here for an admin to set somebody else's
password: an address on the roster with no password is an identity waiting for
the signup and reset flows in #650, not one an operator should be able to take
over.

**Claiming a deployment.** First boot leaves a standalone deployment with an
operator identity that has no address and no password
(`gateway.services.tenancy.provisioning_service`), and with the master key still
accepted as the dashboard login. The first call here *by that identity* supplies
an address and a password, and that single act is what retires master-key
sign-in and turns email and password into the steady-state login
(mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716). Nothing schedules it and nothing expires: a
deployment that never claims goes on signing in with the master key
indefinitely, including one where every member has since set a password of their
own, because the credential this retires resolves to the operator and to nobody
else (#702).

**Which proof is required, and why it differs.** The table is small and every
row has a reason:

| Caller | Identity has a password | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Master key, in a header | no | nothing further: the claim |
| Master key, in a header | yes | nothing further: operator recovery |
| Session cookie | no | nothing further: the session itself is the proof |
| Session cookie | yes | the current password |

A cookie-authenticated caller with no password is the ordinary state of somebody
who signs in through Google, GitHub or a passkey, and of a roster entry that
never set one. There is no old password to prove, and the session in hand is
already a completed sign-in, so this is where such an identity gains a password
rather than a wall it cannot get past (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#2099). The dashboard
renders that form from ``has_password`` on the membership context's ``caller``,
which is the same question asked ahead of the request.

The master key never has to present the current one because it is the
deployment-wide credential: a caller holding it can already do anything the
management API can, so demanding a password they have forgotten would lock the
dashboard while leaving the API open. That is what keeps this change from being
able to strand an operator, and it is why no separate reset endpoint is needed
before #650 ships one for people who hold no master key.
