    Keeping this in one place is what makes the paginator's total (``/count``)
    match the rows ``list_usage`` returns. One condition sits outside it:
    ``count_usage`` also narrows ``counts_toward_budget=false`` to imported rows,
    because that call sizes a mutation rather than a page (see its docstring).

    ``scope`` is the one condition that is not a filter. The deployment-wide
    routes here pass ``None`` and read every row; the organization-scoped routes
    in ``organization_usage.py`` pass the predicate their caller's membership
    resolved to, so it is ANDed in alongside whatever the client asked for and a
    client-supplied ``workspace_id`` can only ever narrow it further.

    Deliberately **without a default**, unlike every filter beside it. It is a
    parameter so that a route building these conditions cannot forget the half
    that makes them safe, and a default is exactly what would let it: the
    forgotten case reads every tenant's rows and says nothing. Required, a new
    scoped route that omits it is a ``TypeError`` at import rather than a
    cross-tenant read in production, which is the difference between the
    docstring asserting the property and the signature enforcing it.

    Bounds are pinned to UTC here rather than only in ``_resolve_window``, which
    the summary endpoints route through but the list and count endpoints do not:
    an offset-less bound would otherwise resolve against the process's local

    Range-bounded (default last 30 days, hard-capped): unlike the raw ``/api/v1/usage``
    list, every aggregate is scoped to a bounded window so it stays served by the
    timestamp index. Returns grand totals, breakdowns by model / user / API key /
    source / session (``source_label``) / endpoint / provider (top rows plus a
    reconciling ``other`` fold, billed token counts), the error taxonomy grouped
    by failure status code, and a UTC-bucketed time series carrying each bucket's
    error count and billed token composition (input incl. cache, cache read/write,
    output).

    Each breakdown is its own ``GROUP BY`` pass, so a caller that reads only the
    totals or the series should narrow ``dimensions`` rather than pay for all eight
    (the dashboard's tiles, timeline context, and model typeahead all do). Omitting
    the parameter keeps the full set.

    ``model``, ``user_id``, and ``api_key_id`` are repeatable: several values match
    any of them, so one chart can compare a handful of models, users, or keys.
