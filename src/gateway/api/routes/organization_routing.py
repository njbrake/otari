"""The routing configuration of the caller's own organization, for a tenant.

``/api/v1/routing/policies`` and ``/api/v1/aliases`` are deployment-wide and
operator-only, which is right: they list every tenant's stored rows and take a
``workspace_id`` the client supplies, so nothing but the operator gate stands
between a signed-in member and another organization's routing (the escalation
otari-ai#1880 closed). These routers are a second, narrower reading and writing
of the same tables, shaped like ``organization_usage.py``
(mozilla-ai/otari#837), giving the roles matrix what it asks for: View for a
member, Edit for an admin (otari-ai#1942, otari-ai#1969).

* **Scope is derived, never accepted.** The organization comes from the caller's
  own ``active_organization_id`` by way of ``resolve_visible_workspace_scope``,
  which refuses a pointer with no live membership behind it. No request here
  names an organization.
* **How much of it a read covers** follows the rule the workspace list uses: an
  owner or an admin reads every workspace in the organization, and
  a member or viewer reads the ones they actively belong to. A member who
  belongs to no workspace still gets the config-file entries, which are
  deployment-wide and in force in every workspace they could ever join.
* **Both reads are bounded.** ``limit`` caps the stored rows a request
  materializes, and the config-file entries are appended within the same cap, so
  neither response grows with the tenant. The default is the cap rather than a
  page, because the dashboard renders policies and aliases as one sorted table
  and a page of one beside every row of the other would be incoherent; the bound
  is there for the organization that outgrows the page, not to paginate the page.
* **Workspace-wide rows only, on the reads as much as the writes.** A stored row
  may be scoped to one ``users.user_id`` as well as to a workspace, and neither
  half of this surface handles that scope. The write refuses ``user_id`` because
  it is a deployment-wide identifier; the read has to agree, or an admin is shown
  a row they cannot address. While these were listed, Delete on one carried no
  user scope, so it matched ``user_id IS NULL`` and destroyed the workspace-wide
  row of that name while answering 204. A tenant cannot interpret the identifier
  either: it names an API-key user, where a dashboard member is a tenancy UUID.
* **A write needs a named workspace, resolved inside the organization.** There is
  no default-workspace fallback here, unlike the operator routers: the
  deployment's default workspace is not the tenant's to write into unless it
  happens to be one of theirs, and a silent fallback is how it would become one.

Aliases and policies did not need an owner column for any of this. Both tables
already carry a non-nullable ``workspace_id``, and a workspace belongs to exactly
one organization, so the row's tenant is a join away. That is why this follows
mozilla-ai/otari#875's shape (a ``/api/v1/organizations/me/*`` router over the same
rows) without following its migration.

**What stops a tenant widening their own access.** A policy or an alias decides
which real model a name reaches, so an unconstrained write is a way to name a
model the tenant may not call. Every target here is put through the same
allow-list the catalog is filtered by
(``services/tenancy/organization_model_access``), so an admin can only point a
name at something their organization already reaches. That check, not the
operator gate, is what makes these writes safe to open.
