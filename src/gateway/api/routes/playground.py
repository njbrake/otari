"""The Playground: an in-product chat page, served to a dashboard session.

otari-ai#1947 asked for the Playground back after the hosted original was
retired (otari-ai#1920), and otari#663 is the port. This router is its whole
server side: one completion endpoint plus the page's own memory.

**How a completion here is authorized, and why it is not a loosened
``/chat/completions``.** The public completion route accepts an API key or the
deployment's master key and nothing else, because a keyless request resolves to
the *default* workspace, so honoring a dashboard cookie there would let any
signed-in member of any organization spend the default organization's BYO
credential and bill it (otari-ai#1880). That route is untouched. This one
authenticates the session, resolves the caller's own attribution user and proves
their membership of the workspace it will bill
(``playground_service.resolve_playground_principal``), and hands the result to
the same pipeline as a
:class:`~gateway.types.session_principal.SessionPrincipal`. Nothing about
routing, budget, guardrails, tools, pricing or settlement is reimplemented here:
``run_chat_completion`` is the same function the public route calls, so the two
paths cannot drift.

The hosted original solved this by minting a short-lived bearer and handing it
to the browser (otari-ai#1598). This does not, and that is the one deliberate
departure from what otari#663 wrote down: a credential in JavaScript is strictly
worse than no credential in JavaScript, and the constraint the issue was
protecting, that the browser never holds a durable key, is honored more strongly
by holding none at all. `docs/access-control.md` already says sessions are the
dashboard's credential.

**Everything else here is the page's memory, and it is per identity.** Consent,
saved transcripts, rated comparisons and pinned models all carry the caller's
own ``user_id`` as a query predicate rather than a post-load check, so another
identity's row answers exactly as a nonexistent one does. otari-ai#978 was a
comparisons list that trusted a client-supplied scope and leaked prompts and
model outputs across organizations; the predicate is what makes that
unreachable rather than merely fixed.

**Hosted serves the same page and forwards the one request that dispatches.**
A hosted control plane runs no inference (otari#822), so on that deployment the
completion below hands the resolved principal to
``services/playground_dispatch`` instead of to the local pipeline: it is
presented to ``config.data_plane_url`` as an API key that never leaves this
process, and the gateway there runs the pipeline and reports the usage that
debits the wallet. Everything else on this router is management traffic and is
served locally either way, so the page is whole rather than half-mounted.

Hybrid mode is the one deployment that serves none of this. It has no dashboard
session and no local tenancy to resolve one against, so
``main._register_core_routers`` mounts the router for standalone and hosted and
not for hybrid.
