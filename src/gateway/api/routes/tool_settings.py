"""Built-in tool & guardrail configuration for the admin dashboard.

The service-endpoint and web-search fields that ``/api/v1/settings`` keeps
display-only (the ``*_url`` fields and the web-search knobs are excluded there on
SSRF grounds) are made editable here, on their own page, with structural URL
validation and per-service reachability tests. Standalone-only and master-key
gated, mirroring the other management routers.

* ``GET /api/v1/tool-settings`` returns each field's effective value (the value a
  request would actually use), grouped by service, with URL passwords masked. It
  is the one verb here a non-operator may call, because the roles matrix has the
  Tools pages at View for a member (otari-ai#1969): a member is told what the
  built-in tools will do to their requests, and the service endpoints are
  withheld from them entirely rather than masked. Masking a URL still publishes
  the host, which is internal infrastructure and the input to the SSRF gates on
  the Settings page.
* ``PATCH /api/v1/tool-settings`` persists overrides (an explicit ``null`` clears a
  field back to the configured env/YAML default; an omitted field is unchanged)
  and applies them to the running worker.
* ``POST /api/v1/tool-settings/{service}/test`` structurally validates a (typically
  unsaved) URL and probes it for reachability, returning ``{ok, reason}``.
* ``GET /api/v1/tool-settings/guardrails/profiles`` reads the guardrail catalog off
  the service ``guardrails_url`` names. It sits here because that field is the
  only input it takes, and on the reader router for the reason the GET above is:
  a profile name is what a caller puts in a request body, so the set of them is
  not the operator's to withhold, and the endpoint they were read from does not
  appear in the answer.
* ``GET /api/v1/tool-settings/guardrails/catalog`` lists the guardrails this
  gateway can run itself, from the installed ``any_guardrail``. On the operator
  router, unlike the profiles read beside it: it is the picker behind a form that
  stores a vendor credential deployment-wide, which is not a tenant's to read.
