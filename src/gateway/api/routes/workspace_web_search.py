"""Per-workspace web-access configuration (standalone mode only).

The deployment-wide search backend (its URL, its engines, its purpose hint)
stays on ``/api/v1/tool-settings``, and the tools ``POST /api/v1/search`` dispatches to
stay on ``/api/v1/search-tools``; this surface says which workspaces on that
deployment may search or fetch and which domains those operations may reach. Thin composition
over `gateway.services.tenancy.workspace_web_search_service`, following
`routes/workspace_code_execution_policy.py`'s shape (master key on the router,
plus the caller's tenancy identity for the per-workspace role checks).
