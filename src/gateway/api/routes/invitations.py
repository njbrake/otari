"""Accepting an organization invitation (standalone mode only).

Deliberately public: the person following an emailed link holds no master
key and no session, and the token in the link is their whole proof of
anything here. Both routes therefore take no ``CurrentIdentity`` and are
scoped to exactly the one invitation the token names.

No session is minted on accept: accepting resolves the membership to
``active``, the same place ``POST /me/members`` already lands a member added
directly. An invitee who has never signed in can set a password in the same
call, which is the only way in on a deployment that sends no mail; without one,
the identity stays password-less until ``POST /api/v1/auth/signup`` or a
provider sign-in claims it.
