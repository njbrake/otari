"""The caller's own API keys, for a tenant who does not operate the deployment.

``/api/v1/keys`` is deployment-wide and operator-only (otari-ai#1880), which left a
hosted organization member with no way to mint a key at all: they could not use
the product without an operator handing them one out of band
(mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1941). The answer is not a looser gate on that router,
which scopes to the caller's whole active organization and takes a client-named
``user_id``; it is the same second-surface shape ``organization_usage.py``
established for usage reads (otari#837), applied to a write surface:

* **Ownership is derived, never accepted.** A key minted here is billed to the
  caller's own attribution row (``users.user_id`` = the identity's UUID as a
  string, the row ``get_or_create_attribution_user`` mints and the activation
  guide already keys on), and every load below carries that owner predicate.
  There is no ``user_id`` parameter, so there is nothing for an escalation to
  travel on, and somebody else's key answers the 404 a nonexistent one does. An
  owner an operator has revoked through ``DELETE /api/v1/users`` stays revoked: this
  surface refuses rather than reviving the row, which is what would restore the
  spend that route deactivated.
* **The workspace must be one the caller may see.** A named ``workspace_id``
  goes through ``resolve_workspace_in_organization``, so a workspace in another
  organization, or one in this organization the caller is not a member of,
  answers 404 exactly as one that does not exist. Omitting it targets the
  organization's default workspace, put through the same check.
* **No budget bypass.** The operator's create takes ``exclude_from_budget``;
  this one does not, and always mints an enforced key: a member exempting their
  own key from budget would be minting their own unlimited spend.

The operator's deployment-wide view keeps the gate it has, unchanged. A key
minted here shows up there like any other row in the organization, and the
narrow-only ``allowed_models`` rule binds against the caller's own user default
exactly as it does on the operator surface.
