"""Caller-orchestrated MCP: stored-server tool discovery and one-shot execution.

For an application that uses Otari as its routing layer and owns its own
authorization policy. It asks Otari for the tool definitions a stored MCP server
exposes, lets a model, a person, or a workflow propose a call, applies whatever
policy it has (a human approval prompt, an administrator rule, trusted
read-only auto-authorization), and then asks Otari to execute that one exact
call.

**Otari does not verify a human approval and does not claim to** (R-AUTH-4).
The calling application is the authorization boundary. What Otari enforces
independently is authentication, that the stored server is one the authenticated
workspace may reach, the stored tool allowlist, URL safety, and its own
execution bounds.

Nothing is held open across a caller's decision: no model stream, no MCP
session, no database session, no worker-local state. That is the whole reason
these are two separate requests rather than a pause inside the managed tool
loop.

The managed loop in ``services/mcp_loop.py`` remains a separate supported
integration mode, for a client that wants Otari to own the model/tool loop.
