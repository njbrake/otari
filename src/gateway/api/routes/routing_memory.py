"""Teaching the learned router: scored examples and warmth (standalone only).

A policy that names ``router: knn`` decides nothing until someone has told the
gateway which candidate is good enough for which kind of prompt. Two routes:

* ``POST /api/v1/routing/preferences/rank`` records the quality each candidate earned
  on a prompt, writing the routing-memory records the router later votes over. It
  takes a batch, because a pool needs ``router_seed_count`` examples (20 by
  default) before it routes at all, and twenty round trips is not a workflow.
* ``GET /api/v1/routing/status`` reports how warm each pool is, so an operator can see
  when the router will start routing and which policies depend on it.

There is deliberately no endpoint that fans a prompt out to the candidates for
you. Seeing what each candidate answers is what ``POST /api/v1/chat/completions``
already does, one call per candidate, and going through that path means the calls
are budget-checked and land in the usage log like all other provider spend. A
convenience endpoint that skipped both would be the only unmetered way to spend
money through this gateway.

Operator-gated, like ``/api/v1/routing/policies``, with ``user_id`` naming whose
memory is being taught rather than taking it from the calling key: which model
serves a caller is an operator decision, exactly as a policy's targets are.

Routing memory is **per user and per workspace**, even for a workspace-wide
policy: the records hold the prompts a user sends, so sharing them across users
would let one caller's traffic steer another's, and sharing them across
workspaces would do the same across tenants for a user who holds keys in both. A
workspace-wide learned policy therefore warms once per user in each workspace.
Both routes take an optional ``workspace_id``; omitting it means the deployment's
default workspace, which is where a master-key request bills and where every row
predating workspace scoping was backfilled.

Known gap, tracked on #187: there is no route that lists or deletes recorded
examples, so a mis-scored example can only be undone in the database. Until that
lands, ``rank`` validates hard (see :func:`_validated_scores`) rather than
accepting anything a typo can produce.

    records the router can never match: ``/status`` reports the pool warm and every
    request declines with "no neighbor scored any candidate in this pool", which is
    visible only in a log line. No route can delete the bad records afterwards.

    Resolution alone is too weak a check: ``openai:gpt-4o-typo`` resolves happily,
    because the prefix names a configured instance and nothing here verifies model
    names. So keys are checked against the union of every learned policy's
    candidates (plus their default targets) for this user in this workspace,
    canonicalized so ``provider/model`` and ``instance:model`` spellings compare
    equal.

    Accepting those spellings is only safe if the stored key is the one the router
    looks up, so the returned map rewrites every accepted key to its canonical
    ``instance:model`` form, which is what :meth:`KnnRoutingMemory._score`
    canonicalizes the candidate pool to. Storing a *policy's* spelling instead
    would only move the mismatch: two learned policies for one user that spell the
    same model differently would agree with one and be invisible to the other.

    When no learned policy resolves for the user, only resolvability is enforced:
    teaching a pool before writing the policy that reads it is a legitimate order
    of operations, and refusing it would make the API demand a specific sequence.
    Those keys are canonicalized too, so the policy written afterwards matches them
    however it spells its candidates. A weighted policy does not count as one that
    resolves: it reads no examples, so letting its pool narrow what may be taught
    would refuse the very examples the learned policy being prepared needs.
