"""Organization context, membership, and switching (standalone mode only).

Thin composition over `gateway.services.tenancy.organization_service`: resolve
the caller's identity, call the service, return its typed result. The response
models come from `gateway.models.tenancy` and are the contracts the dashboard's
generated client is built from, so they keep the platform's shapes.

Nearly every path is scoped to ``/me``, the organization the caller's identity
is pointed at, and cannot name an organization at all. ``POST /me/switch`` is
the one that can, because moving that pointer is the one operation that has to
be told where to; it answers 404 for an organization the caller holds no active
membership in, so the boundary holds there too.

**Why create, switch, and the membership list are here.** A standalone
deployment boots one organization and almost always keeps exactly that, but a
second one is already reachable: invite an address that belongs to an
organization elsewhere on this deployment, they accept, and they hold two
memberships with nothing to switch between them. The tables are this
repository's, and so are the invariants a second organization needs (who
becomes its owner, what its slug is, that it has a workspace to work in), so an
overlay contributing no tables could only fork them. See mozilla-ai/otari#715.

Deleting an organization is still not here, and that is a different question
rather than an oversight: every historical attribution resolves through rows
that hang off it.
