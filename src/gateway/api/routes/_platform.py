    ``"{provider}:{model}"``) plus a per-attempt ``on_first_response``
    callback. Tool-loop callers thread that callback into ``mcp_tool_loop``
    (and its per-format siblings) so it fires exactly once after the first
    upstream response — locking the request in to the current attempt. The
    runner is agnostic to the response shape; ``extract_usage`` pulls the
    usage object out for reporting and ``on_success`` lets the caller mutate
    the FastAPI response object on success.

    Lock-in semantics: once ``on_first_response`` has fired on an attempt,
    any subsequent error from that attempt terminates the request instead of
    falling through. A tool-use loop's intermediate state (provider-specific
    ``tool_call`` ids / reasoning blocks) cannot be transparently replayed
    on a different provider. Pre-lock-in failures still walk the attempts
    list and fall through to the next provider. Classification only labels the
    attempt for logging and platform usage reporting.

    ``MaxToolIterationsExceeded`` is treated as a gateway-side cap hit, not
    an upstream failure — it raises a distinct 422 and does not advance to
    the next attempt.

    If every attempt fails the runner raises 504 on timeout. Otherwise a
    single-attempt failure is classified into a specific safe status
    (400/404/429/...) when the upstream error carries one (via
    ``_provider_failure_http_exc``), falling back to a generic 502; a
    multi-attempt fallthrough keeps the generic 502 "All upstream providers
    failed" rather than attributing one provider's status to the whole set.

    Callers are expected to hand a non-empty ``attempts`` list — the platform
    resolve endpoint guarantees one. Passing an empty list is a caller
    programming error (the route handler should have raised 502 with
    "no resolvable provider" already); the runner surfaces it as a 500 so the

    a ``Literal``, not a bare ``str``, so a typo at a ``kind == "..."``
    comparison site (e.g. in :func:`_classify_upstream_error`) is a mypy error
    instead of a silent no-op. Shared by :func:`_classify_upstream_error`
    (drives the hybrid-mode fallback decision) and
    :func:`gateway.api.routes._pipeline.classify_provider_error` (drives the
    final client-facing status/detail), so the two stay in sync.

    Recognizes, in order, walking ``.original_exception`` when the current
    exception carries no signal of its own:

    1. Stdlib/httpx timeout and network exceptions directly.
    2. The OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs' own ``APITimeoutError`` /
       ``APIConnectionError``. any-llm calls these SDKs directly (it does not
       wrap httpx itself unless ``ANY_LLM_UNIFIED_EXCEPTIONS=1``), and both
       SDKs catch ``httpx.TimeoutException`` / network errors internally and
       re-raise as their own types. Those wrapped types are not instances of
       any httpx exception and carry no ``status_code``/``response``, so a
       real provider timeout or "provider unreachable" would otherwise be
       unclassifiable. ``APITimeoutError`` subclasses ``APIConnectionError``
       in both SDKs, so the timeout check must run first. This covers the
       majority of any-llm providers, which reuse ``BaseOpenAIProvider`` or
       ``BaseAnthropicProvider``.
    3. An HTTP error status carried by the exception, on ``status_code``,
       ``code``, or its attached ``.response`` (see
       :func:`_error_status_code`).
    4. A conservative duck-typed fallback, by exception class name, for the
       remaining any-llm provider SDKs that don't reuse the OpenAI/Anthropic
       base classes (e.g. cohere, mistral, groq, bedrock) and whose own
       timeout/connection exception types aren't imported here. Mirrors the
       heuristic ``any_llm.utils.exception_handler.convert_exception`` already
       uses internally. Only applies when the exception carries no status code
       at all, so it never shadows a real HTTP-status classification.
    5. If none of the above match, ``.original_exception`` (set by any-llm's
       ``AnyLLMError`` family, e.g. via ``convert_exception``) is unwrapped and
       reclassified from step 1. This keeps detection working once
       ``ANY_LLM_UNIFIED_EXCEPTIONS=1`` becomes the default: any-llm's
       ``convert_exception`` re-wraps a raw SDK timeout/connection error into
       a generic ``any_llm.exceptions.ProviderError`` (class name matches
       neither ``*TimeoutError`` nor ``*ConnectionError``, no ``status_code``),
       but always preserves the original SDK exception on
       ``original_exception``. Bounded by an ``id()``-based seen-set so a
