"""Passkey ceremonies and the credentials a person manages (standalone only).

Two ceremonies, each two calls, plus a small CRUD surface over what they
produce. The split from ``auth_session.py`` is the one that file's docstring
already anticipated: a passkey needs a server-issued challenge before the
browser can answer, so it cannot be another field on the sign-in body. What it
shares with that endpoint is the end, not the beginning: a passkey sign-in mints
the same HttpOnly session cookie a password does, through the same
`gateway.services.dashboard_session_service`, so everything downstream of a
sign-in is unchanged.

**Which half is public.** ``/authenticate/options`` and ``/authenticate`` are
unauthenticated by necessity: they are how somebody who is not signed in signs
in. Both are throttled per client IP through ``throttle_public_auth``, like the
signup and reset routes. Everything else here (registering a passkey, listing,
renaming and deleting them) is behind the ordinary management credential, so a
passkey is always added by somebody who is already inside.

**Why registration is not a signup.** There is no way to arrive here without an
identity: registration attaches a credential to the caller's own session
identity. A deployment is still claimed with the master key and a password, and
a passkey joins an identity rather than creating one. See
`gateway.services.tenancy.webauthn_service`.

The options a ceremony issues, and the answer a browser sends back, are carried
as free-form objects rather than modeled field by field; see ``CeremonyOptions``
for why.
