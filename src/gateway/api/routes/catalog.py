"""The catalog grouped by model: one entry per model, one offering per selector.

``GET /api/v1/models`` answers an SDK, so it is flat and OpenAI-shaped: one object per
selector, and ``nebius:zai-org/GLM-5.3`` and ``fireworks:accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p3``
are two unrelated rows. This router answers a person choosing a model. It reads
the same merged catalog (``models.build_merged_catalog``, so the two cannot
disagree about which selectors the caller may see), folds the selectors by
``services.model_identity``, and joins what a chooser needs onto each: the
models.dev description and capabilities, the provider's context and output
limits, and the price *this viewer* would be charged, with the rung it comes
from named.

That last part is the one thing the flat listing gets wrong for a tenant: it
prices from the deployment list, while a request from an organization holding a
negotiated override is billed at the override. Here the organization is
resolved the way settlement resolves it (the session's active organization, or
the API key's workspace's), never from a header.

Metadata is served to every catalog reader, where ``GET /api/v1/models/metadata``
is operator-only. That gate is inherited from the deployment-wide router the
route sits on and describes the operator's configured providers; a model's
public description and capabilities describe the model, and a member choosing
one needs them as much as an operator does.
