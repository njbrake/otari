"""Walk an ordered list of attempts, returning the first that succeeds.

This is the executor half of routing: something upstream decides *which*
candidates to try and in what order (a local routing policy, or the platform's
resolve response in hybrid mode), and this module tries them. It makes no
selection decisions of its own, which is the property that keeps the data plane
free of routing logic (see ARCHITECTURE.md).

It deliberately does **not** settle the budget. A reservation is per request,
not per attempt, so the caller reserves once, calls this, and reconciles or
refunds once against the attempt that actually served the request. Settling in
here would double-charge a chain.

Relationship to :func:`gateway.api.routes._platform.run_platform_attempts`: that
one is the hybrid-mode walker, coupled to the platform's ``ResolvedAttempt``
shape and its per-attempt upstream reporting. This one is credential-agnostic
(:class:`gateway.types.attempt.Attempt` carries an opaque ``kwargs`` dict), so a
locally resolved attempt with no API key at all works. The two share the error
classification and the terminal-status mapping, so a failure looks the same to a
caller whichever walker produced it. Hybrid stays on its own walker for now;
moving it here is a follow-up guarded by the settlement characterization tests in
``tests/unit/test_pipeline_settlement.py``.

Import direction: this module imports ``_platform`` for the shared classifier and
status mapping, and ``_pipeline`` imports this one. ``_platform`` already defers
its own import of ``_pipeline`` to break a pre-existing cycle, so this adds no
new edge.

    ``run_attempt`` receives the attempt, its merged call kwargs, and a
    ``mark_locked_in`` callback that tool-loop callers fire once the upstream has
    produced its first assistant message.

    ``on_terminal`` is called with the candidate the walk actually stopped on,
    before the terminal error is raised. The caller cannot infer it: exhaustion
    reaches the last candidate, while a tool-loop lock-in, a gateway-side refusal
    for one candidate (a refused reservation top-up, an unpriced fallback), or the
    tool-iteration cap can stop the walk early. In those cases, attributing the
    failure to the end of the plan would name a provider that was never called.

    ``on_absorbed`` is awaited for each provider failure the walk *recovers* from
    with another candidate left to try. It exists so the caller can
    record the failure without it counting as a request error, since the request
    itself is still going to be served. It is not called for a terminal failure: that
    one is the request's outcome and the caller logs it as such.

    ``build_kwargs`` builds each candidate's call kwargs, defaulting to
    :meth:`Attempt.call_kwargs`. Formats whose provider call takes a different
    shape pass their own (the responses format splits ``provider`` from ``model``
    and rebuilds its Codex extra-body per provider), so the transformation happens
    for the candidate being tried rather than for the one that failed.

    Lock-in semantics, matching the hybrid walker: once ``mark_locked_in`` has
    fired, a later failure on that attempt terminates the request instead of
    falling through, because a tool-use loop's intermediate state (provider
    specific tool-call ids, reasoning blocks) cannot be replayed on a different
    provider.

    Failures that are not the provider's fault do not advance the plan:
    ``MaxToolIterationsExceeded`` is a gateway-side cap (422), and an unreachable
    sandbox or web-search backend is gateway-side infrastructure that serves
    every attempt equally, so trying the next candidate cannot help.

    On exhaustion: 504 when the last failure was a timeout, the classified status
    when there was only one candidate (so a single-candidate policy answers
    exactly as naming that model directly would), and a generic 502 for a
    multi-candidate fallthrough, which aggregates heterogeneous failures and must
    not attribute one provider's status to the whole plan.
