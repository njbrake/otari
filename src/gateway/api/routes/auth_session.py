"""Dashboard sign-in sessions (standalone mode only).

``POST /api/v1/auth/session`` exchanges a credential for a server-issued session
held in an HttpOnly cookie, so the dashboard never persists that credential in
the browser and a sign-in survives tab closes and restarts. ``DELETE`` is
sign-out. The cookie is honored by the master-key auth dependencies in
``gateway.api.deps`` when a request carries no header credentials, and it names
the identity it was minted for, so those dependencies resolve a caller from it.

**Two credentials, one at a time, and which one depends on the deployment.**
mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716 settled that the master key bootstraps a standalone
deployment and then retires as its dashboard login, staying the deployment-wide
API credential. So:

- Until the bootstrap operator has a password, the master key signs in here,
  provisioning the default organization and its workspace and binding the
  session to that operator. This is first boot, and it is unchanged.
- Once that identity has a password (an operator claimed the deployment through
  ``PUT /api/v1/auth/password``), the master key is refused *for sign-in*, and email
  and password is the login. It is the operator's own password that decides
  this and no other identity's (#702): a member who signs up or resets theirs
  claims their account, not the deployment. The master key still authenticates
  ``/api/v1/keys``, ``/api/v1/users`` and the rest of the management surface through the
  header, which is what every self-hoster's automation and the OSS smoke gate
  use.

``GET /api/v1/bootstrap`` publishes which of the two a deployment is currently
accepting, so the login page asks for the credential that will work rather than
discovering it from a 403.

**Maintenance mode freezes this endpoint and nothing else.** While it is on,
every credential here is refused with 503 so nobody starts a session during a
redeploy, but a session already minted keeps working and the management API and
the data plane are untouched. See ``services/maintenance_mode_service.py``.

#651 and #652 add further credentials (OAuth, WebAuthn). Both are redirect or
ceremony flows with more than one round trip, so they get their own endpoints
rather than another field here; what they share with this one is the session
those flows end by minting, not the request that starts them.

    so a client knows who it is signed in as without a second call.

    The rate-limit check deliberately runs only after a failed verification,
    not before it: a pre-verification gate can't know whether *this* attempt
    would have succeeded, so once an IP has used up its failure quota it
    would end up blocking that IP's legitimate owner too, not just further
    attackers. Running after verification also means the throttle bounds how
    many verdicts an IP gets, not how much work it can cause: a password attempt
    pays for a bcrypt verification (cost 12, on the order of 200ms of CPU, and
    one is burned against a stand-in hash even for an address nobody holds)
    before the limit is consulted, so a 429 costs the same as a 401. A gateway

    verification per attempt and the refusal is not about the credential
