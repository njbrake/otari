    2. For a non-master key, spend is *always* bound to the key's own user.
       The request may echo the same user_id (e.g. OpenAI's ``user`` field for
       tracking), but naming a *different* user is rejected — otherwise any key
       could charge spend to, and exhaust the budget of, another user.

        user_id_from_request: User identifier extracted from the request body
        api_key: Authenticated API key object (None when using master key)
        is_master_key: Whether the request was authenticated with a master key

            ignored and spend is still bound to the key's own user (the client
