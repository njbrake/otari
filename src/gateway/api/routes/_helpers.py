    caller's organization mandates and any a routing policy mandates (see
    :func:`gateway.api.routes._pipeline.merge_guardrail_layers`, which is where
    the merge happens so every completion endpoint enforces a mandate alike).
    ``credentials`` carries the bearer credential an organization entry stores
    for the endpoint it names, keyed by profile; it never comes from the request
    body. ``mandated`` names the profiles a layer above the caller supplied,
    which is what decides whether a URL that fails its safety check is the
    caller's malformed request (a 400 naming their own URL) or a stored entry
    being unevaluable (governed by its ``mode`` / ``on_unavailable``, with the
    endpoint kept out of the response). ``in_process`` carries the guardrails
    this worker holds for the organization's own definitions, keyed by profile;
    one of those is answered here rather than sent to any service, and a profile
    whose guardrail this worker does not hold arrives as ``None`` and is
    unevaluable.

    No-op when ``guardrails`` is empty/None (zero overhead for the common
    case). On a ``block``-mode flag, raises ``403`` and the provider is never
    called. On a non-blocking flag (``monitor`` mode), attaches a compact
    summary to the :data:`GUARDRAILS_RESULT_HEADER` response header and lets
    the request proceed.

    Service-failure handling depends on ``mode`` and ``on_unavailable`` (see
    :func:`gateway.services.guardrails.run_input_guardrails`): a ``block``
    guardrail that can't be evaluated fails closed (``502``) unless it sets
    ``on_unavailable="monitor"``; a ``monitor`` guardrail fails open (logged,
    request proceeds).

    Note:
        The header is set on the injected ``response``, so it reaches
        non-streaming responses. For streamed responses (where the route
        returns its own ``StreamingResponse``) the ``monitor`` annotation is
        not currently propagated; ``block`` still applies (it raises before any
        bytes are streamed).

    Raises:
        HTTPException: ``400`` when a *caller-supplied* guardrail's ``url``
            fails the SSRF/scheme safety check (a mandated entry's failure is a
            502 or a recorded inconclusive instead, per its own settings);
            ``403`` when a ``block`` guardrail flags the input; ``502`` when a
            ``block`` guardrail that fails closed can't be evaluated. The 502
            body names the profile and not the endpoint, which goes to the log
            instead.
