"""Shared request-pipeline core for the chat / messages / responses routes.

The three completion-style endpoints speak different wire formats but run the
same pipeline: authenticate (platform resolve or local key + budget pre-debit),
apply input guardrails, extract gateway-managed tools, dispatch to the provider
(directly or through a tool-loop backend), and settle the budget reservation
when the request finishes. This module owns that pipeline once; each route
supplies a small :class:`FormatAdapter` for the format-specific edges (request
parsing, SSE chunk shape, error envelope, provider call, tool loop).

Settlement invariants owned here:

* ``reserve_budget`` happens in :func:`resolve_request_context` (standalone
  mode only); every downstream success path reconciles via
  :func:`reconcile_reservation` and every failure path refunds via
  :func:`refund_reservation`, including streaming completions, streams that
  end without usage data (``stream_missing_usage_policy``), client
  disconnects, and pre-stream dispatch failures.
* The streaming settlement callbacks (``on_complete`` / ``on_no_usage`` /
  ``on_error`` / ``on_incomplete``) are built in exactly one place,
  :func:`build_streaming_response`, and are wired identically for the
  single-attempt and platform-fallback paths of every format.
* Backend open semantics: sandbox and web_search backends open eagerly so an
  unreachable backend surfaces as an HTTP 502 before the 200 OK header; the
  MCP pool opens lazily inside the stream generator (single-attempt paths) or
  eagerly on an ``AsyncExitStack`` shared across attempts (platform fallback).
* Every gateway-side rejection that reaches a known user records an error row
  via :func:`log_gateway_rejection`, so refused traffic is visible in the
  activity log and countable by the dashboard's failure count instead of
  vanishing. That function documents which rejections deliberately do not log.

      so they keep the generic 502 and stay on the error-rate panel as the
      upstream-or-gateway failures they are.
    * The failing callable must not be a constructor. ``client_args`` is
      operator-owned and reaches a provider *client's* ``__init__``, so a key
      there that happens to collide with a real param name (``client_args={"seed":
      1}``) would otherwise pass the first gate and read as the caller's ``seed``.

    Both gates key on the same interpreter wording the match already depends on,
    so neither adds a new assumption about how CPython phrases the error.

    Standalone mode: validate the API key, resolve the billed user, check the
    rate limit, then reserve the estimated cost. The reservation is taken
    before the missing-pricing gate so user/blocked/budget rejections
    (404/403) take precedence over the 402; it is refunded if the request is
    then rejected for missing pricing.

    ``session_principal`` (standalone only) replaces that credential step for a
    route that authenticated and authorized the caller itself, which today is
    the Playground's own completions endpoint. See :class:`SessionPrincipal` for
    what the route owes before it may build one; everything after the step it
    substitutes, the rate limit, the plan compile, both allow-list gates,
    pricing and the reservation, runs exactly as it does for a keyed request.

    ``routing_signal`` (standalone only) builds what a policy's router backend
    reads: the prompt text plus the routing headers, in a format-neutral value the
    endpoint knows how to flatten. A factory rather than a value because only a
    policy with a router consults it. Omit it and such a policy serves its default
    target, which is the correct behavior for a surface that has no prompt.

    ``normalize_messages`` (standalone only) is an optional hook the file
    feature uses to resolve uploaded attachments into the wire payload before
    the cost estimate. It runs after the billed user is known (file access is
    user-scoped) and after the provider/model split (capability detection needs
    it), and returns the post-normalization prompt-char count so the reservation
    reflects any text extracted from attachments. It is never called in hybrid
    mode, where the files feature is unavailable. It returns
    ``(prompt_chars, vision_usage)``; any vision describe side-call it made is
    metered and billed here as committed spend (the call already happened, so it

    * A **request-body** server is the caller's own, so a rejection is their
      malformed request and the reason travels back to them, naming the URL they
      sent. That is the pre-existing behavior.
    * A **stored** server (resolved from ``mcp_server_ids``) is workspace
      configuration the caller can neither see nor fix, and the rejection names
      the host and the range it resolved into. ``routes/workspace_mcp_servers``
      gates even the *read* of those rows behind the master key, on the grounds
      that they name the endpoints this gateway connects to, so echoing one to
      any key holder gives away what that gate is there to withhold. It answers
      the way an unreadable stored token already does: a fixed 500 detail, with
      the reason and the workspace in the log, since a stored endpoint that
      fails its check is the operator's problem and not the caller's.

    *not* cancel the other in-flight checks: they keep running in the

    ``validate_mcp_url`` has no side effects beyond a DNS lookup.

    This used to run synchronously inside a Pydantic ``model_validator`` at
    request-body-parse time (see ``McpServerConfig``/``GuardrailConfig``
    docstrings). It moved here because the DNS lookup must be awaited, and
    Pydantic validators can't await. One observable side effect: a rejected

    Gateway-side rejections used to raise without writing anything, so an
    operator had no way to see that live traffic was being dropped: the activity
    log showed nothing and the dashboard's failure count read 0 for the duration
    of the incident. The row carries ``status="error"`` (what the count and its
    drill-down read) and no cost, so it makes the drop visible and countable
    without ever moving spend or the budget.

    Callers own the reservation: refund it before calling this, exactly as the
    pre-existing rejection sites do. Nothing here touches the budget.

    ``status_code`` is the status the caller is about to return, and it is
    required rather than optional: a rejection row without one classifies as
    ``unknown`` in the failure taxonomy (``errors_by_status_code``), which is
    indistinguishable from a pre-column historical row. It is always statically
    known here, since these are the gateway's own refusals rather than upstream
    faults, so there is nothing to infer from an exception.

    ``counts_toward_budget`` is always True. The dashboard classifies
    ``counts_toward_budget=False`` rows as imported usage and offers them for
    bulk delete and set-price, which must never happen to a row the gateway
    wrote itself. There is no cost on these rows for the flag to gate, so
    pinning it True is safe even for a key flagged ``exclude_from_budget``.

    Some rejections deliberately stay unlogged, and for three different reasons.
    An authentication failure (401) is refused before any user is known: the
    column is nullable, so a NULL-user row would insert fine, but it could not be
    attributed, acted on, or filtered, and writing one would let an
    unauthenticated caller append to the usage table. ``user_id=None`` is
    therefore a no-op here. A 404 for a user that does not exist is skipped for a
    harder reason: ``usage_logs.user_id`` is a foreign key to ``users``, so that
    row could not be inserted at all. A rate-limit rejection (429) is skipped
    because a throttle is expected, self-limiting behavior rather than dropped
    traffic; the client-driven gates that do log (a selector that no longer
    resolves, a model outside an allow-list) are neither self-limiting nor
    expected, which is why the asymmetry is deliberate.

    Every gate that does log sits behind ``check_rate_limit``, so the rows a
    single key can append are bounded by its user's RPM. The one gate that fires
    earlier, the user/key mismatch, charges the bucket itself through
    :func:`throttle_early_rejection` to keep that bound.

    Writing the row is best-effort. Every caller logs and then re-raises the
    rejection it was already going to return, so an exception escaping here
    would replace a clean 403 or 400 with a 500 and make an unhealthy log writer
    look like a broken gateway to the client. Observability must not change the
    response contract, so a failure is swallowed and reported to the gateway log
    instead. ``SingleLogWriter`` already absorbs ``SQLAlchemyError`` itself, so
    what this catches is the rest (session setup or teardown, a writer whose
    queue is gone). Nothing leaks by dropping the row: every call site refunds
    its reservation before calling this, never after.
