"""Format-agnostic engine for the gateway's agentic tool-use loop.

The chat-completions (:mod:`gateway.services.mcp_loop`), Anthropic Messages
(:mod:`gateway.services.mcp_loop_messages`), and OpenAI Responses
(:mod:`gateway.services.mcp_loop_responses`) tool loops run the same
algorithm: call the provider, split the tool calls it produced into
gateway-owned and caller-supplied (foreign) ones, execute the owned calls,
append the assistant turn plus tool results to the transcript, and re-call
the provider until a terminal answer arrives. Only the wire vocabulary
differs (message shapes, terminal events, usage field names). This module
owns the algorithm once; each format contributes a small strategy object
implementing :class:`ToolLoopStrategy` (non-streaming) and
:class:`StreamToolLoopStrategy` (streaming).

Provider functions are intentionally not called from here: each strategy's
``call`` / ``open_stream`` resolves ``acompletion`` / ``amessages`` /
``aresponses`` as a module global of its own format module at call time, so
tests can keep monkeypatching them there.

    returns successfully. Callers use it to lock in the chosen provider: once

    a format that stitches several provider messages into one client-visible
