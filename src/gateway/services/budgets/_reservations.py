    to hand (a tool charge, a batch create) leaves it zero, which is exact for
    those: they consume no provider tokens. The request count needs no argument,

    does the work and any later one is a no-op, so two settlement sites firing for
    one request cannot release the hold twice. A request that outlived its own TTL

    the spend it still owes and releases nothing.

    This is the single authority for writing ``users.spend`` on the billable
    path: the usage-log writer no longer touches spend, so reconciliation must
    run for every served request (even when ``actual_cost`` is 0, to release the
