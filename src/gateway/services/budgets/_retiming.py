"""Move a budget's ceilings onto the cadence it now carries.

A ceiling stores its own window and reads the cadence through its budget.
A change to the budget's period leaves the two in disagreement until the ceilings are retimed.
A ceiling left with no window never rolls, so its spend accumulates while the budget reports a cadence.

    One statement rather than a row per ceiling: the window is derived from the

    Counters are deliberately untouched. Spend already recorded stays, matching
    what re-pointing a ceiling at a different budget does: the ceiling is the same
    allowance held to a different figure from here on, not a fresh one.
    ``reserved_spend`` is left alone too, so a hold taken before the change is
    still released against the counter it came from.

    Not committed here. The caller owns the transaction, so a write that is
    refused afterwards takes the retiming back with it.
