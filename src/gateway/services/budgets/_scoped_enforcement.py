"""Enforce the tenancy-scoped spending ceilings in ``scoped_budgets``.

A request must pass every ceiling attached to a scope it bills to.
The scopes are its workspace, that workspace's organization, the caller's memberships and the API key.
A reservation holds dollars, tokens and requests at once, and a ceiling admits it only when every capped axis has room.
Each ceiling is independent, so the children of a scope may sum to more than their parent.
No hold takes a row lock, so a refusal releases the holds already taken.

    """Record what the request really used on every ceiling and release its holds.

    What is recorded and what is released are separate arguments on every axis,
    because they diverge in two ways. A dollar or token estimate is released while
    the measured figure is recorded; and a reservation the TTL sweep already
    reclaimed has a figure to record and nothing left to release, which is what
    the ``held_*`` arguments express when they are zero.

    ``commit=False`` folds this into a surrounding unit of work; see
    :func:`release`.
