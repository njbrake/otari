"""An organization's own spend budgets and the ceilings that enforce them.

A budget is the figure and the period it is spent over, owned by the organization named on it.
A ceiling names a budget and caps one identity inside the organization at that figure.
Three rules hold across every use case here.
The caller's organization comes from their identity, never from the request.
Only a management role may read or write, because a cap says what colleagues may spend.
Every scope must resolve into the caller's organization and every budget must be owned by it,
and both refusals are 404, so another tenant's row cannot be told from one that was never created.
A budget with no organization belongs to the deployment: nothing here lists, offers or repoints one,
and a ceiling that names one is still listed, with ``manageable`` false, because it caps this organization's spend.
