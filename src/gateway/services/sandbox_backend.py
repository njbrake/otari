"""Dispatch `code_execution` tool calls to a sandbox.

A backend the tool-use loop in :mod:`gateway.services.mcp_loop` dispatches
to whenever the model emits a ``code_execution(code=…)`` call. Everything here
is the half that does not depend on how the code is actually run: the tool the
model is offered, the allow-list, the usage tally, seeding the request's
uploads and collecting what a run produced. Reaching a sandbox at all belongs
to :mod:`gateway.ports.code_execution_port` and the adapters under it, so a
container the operator runs and a hosted provider are the same to this module.
The shapes a run returns are typed in :mod:`gateway.types.code_execution`.

Session lifecycle: enter leases a session, exit releases it, unless a container
registry (``services/code_execution``) is handed in and the adapter says the
session really will outlive the block. Then exit asks the port to hold the
sandbox and records the lease under the ``container_id`` the response carried,
and a later request naming that id enters by resuming it, with the workspace as
the last run left it. A backend that declines to hold a session is released as
it always was, and no container id is reported for it. A warm pool is still
nobody's problem here.

This backend satisfies the same duck-typed protocol the MCP loop uses
for tool dispatch (``openai_tools``, ``owns_tool``, ``purpose_hints``,
``call_tool``), so the loop accepts it as a ``pool`` without any
refactor to :func:`gateway.services.mcp_loop.mcp_tool_loop`.
