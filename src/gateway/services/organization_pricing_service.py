"""An organization's own model rates, above the deployment price list.

The write half of per-organization pricing. The read half is
`services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`, which consults these rows ahead
of ``model_pricing`` and the genai-prices dataset when it is given an
organization.

Three rules live here rather than in the route, because each has to hold for
every writer and none of them can be expressed in the schema at all:

- **A period may not overlap another for the same key.** ``model_pricing`` is a
  version series where a later row shadows an earlier one; an override is a
  commitment for a period, so two periods covering one instant is refused. The
  natural enforcement is a PostgreSQL ``EXCLUDE`` over a range type, and SQLite,
  which the OSS edition ships by default, has neither exclusion constraints nor
  range types. So the rule is checked here and the schema holds the part both
  engines can (a unique index on the period start); see
  `models.pricing.OrganizationModelPricing` for the race that leaves.
- **Only a management role may write.** Rates decide what every member of the
  organization is billed, so this is the same owner-or-admin gate the rest of the
  organization surface uses, delegated to ``OrganizationService`` rather than
  re-deriving membership here.
- **A deployment-supplied model is not the organization's to re-price.** A key
  addressed through one of ``config.providers``' instances dispatches on the
  deployment's own credential, so the deployment settles its upstream bill and
  owns its rate. A bare ``provider:model`` key gets the same refusal when a
  workspace lacks a usable BYO key and the bound ``ModelProviderPort`` would
  serve it on a deployment-owned hosted credential. See
  :meth:`OrganizationPricingService.raise_if_deployment_supplied`.

Periods are half-open, ``[effective_from, effective_to)``. Two adjacent periods
may therefore share an instant (one ends exactly where the next begins) without
overlapping, which is what lets an operator retire a rate and start the next one
at the same timestamp with no gap and no conflict. The resolution query applies
the identical rule, so what is storable and what is resolvable cannot disagree.

        refuses the second. That refusal arrives here, at ``flush``, not at the
        route's ``commit``, so without this it escapes as a 500 and the caller is
        told to retry something that was really a conflict.

        Which ``IntegrityError`` it was decides the answer, so the row is read
        back rather than assumed. A row already occupying this period start is the
        race, and its *own* period is what the message names; anything else (a

        ``exclude_id`` is what keeps that read-back honest on the update path. The

        update that keeps its period and fails the flush for some *other* reason
        would find itself and report a 409 naming the caller's own override.
        Excluding it mirrors ``raise_if_overlapping``'s parameter of the same name,
        and for the same reason.

        The rollback is required rather than tidy: a failed flush leaves the
