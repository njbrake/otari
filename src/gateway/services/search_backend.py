"""Standalone search dispatch for ``POST /v1/search``.

Otari's other web-search surface (:mod:`gateway.services.web_search_backend`)
is an in-loop tool: the model emits ``web_search(query=…)`` and the gateway
answers it mid-completion. This module is the direct one. A caller posts a
query and gets ranked results back, on the same auth, budget, and usage-logging
path as a completion, which is what a sidecar proxying a search API through the
gateway needs.

Tools are keyed by the name callers pass as ``search_tool_name`` (or in the
``/v1/search/{tool}`` path). They come from two places, merged into
``config.search_tools``: ``config.yml`` entries, and rows written at runtime
through ``/v1/search-tools`` and the dashboard (see
:mod:`gateway.services.search_tool_store_service`), with a stored tool winning on
a name collision. A config-file entry looks like::

    search_tools:
      exa-search:
        provider: exa
        api_key: ${EXA_API_KEY}
        options:
          type: fast

``options`` is a mapping of provider-native request fields used as defaults;
fields derived from the request win over it, and ``query`` always comes from
the caller. Every entry is validated by ``validate_search_tool_entry``, at
startup for the config file and per write for a stored tool, so an unsupported
provider or a missing API key fails before the first request.

The other provider is ``searxng``, which speaks the SearXNG-shaped
``GET {api_base}/search?format=json`` contract that
:mod:`gateway.services.web_search_backend` already dispatches the in-loop tool
to. It needs no API key, so the bundled SearXNG container and the Brave and
Tavily fronting adapters are reachable from this endpoint too, and a tool that
declares no ``api_base`` inherits ``web_search_url`` (and, with no ``engines``
option of its own, ``web_search_engines``), so the two surfaces query the same
backend the same way::

    search_tools:
      local:
        provider: searxng   # api_base defaults to web_search_url

Provider calls go through one pooled ``httpx.AsyncClient`` for the process
(:func:`get_search_client`), closed on shutdown by :func:`close_search_client`.
A search is a single request, so a client per call would pay a fresh TCP and TLS
handshake every time and pool nothing.

The wire contract of the route follows LiteLLM's ``/v1/search`` (itself shaped
after Perplexity's Search API) so a caller migrating off the LiteLLM proxy
needs no request changes. Translating that contract to and from each provider's
native shape happens here: the route never sees a provider payload.
