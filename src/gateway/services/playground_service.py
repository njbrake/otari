"""What the Playground page needs from the database, and who it may ask for.

Two halves that look unrelated and are not. :func:`resolve_playground_principal`
is the one that matters: it turns a dashboard session into the principal a
completion may run as, and everything else here is the page's own memory
(consent, saved transcripts, rated comparisons, pinned models), which exists
only because that principal is a real, tenanted caller rather than an anonymous
browser.

The reader of a stored row is always its own owner. Every query below carries
the ``user_id`` predicate rather than checking ownership after loading, so a row
belonging to somebody else answers exactly as a nonexistent one does. That is
not an incidental style: the hosted original leaked prompts and model outputs
across organizations precisely because a list query trusted a client-supplied
scope (otari-ai#978), and a predicate that cannot be omitted is what stops that
from being reachable again.

    one being added.

    What this must not do is prune somebody else's rows, which is why the owner
    predicate is on the select and not only on the delete.

    Deleted by id rather than with an ``ORDER BY ... LIMIT`` on the delete
    itself, which PostgreSQL does not accept and SQLite accepts only when
    compiled for it.
