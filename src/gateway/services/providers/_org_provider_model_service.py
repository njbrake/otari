"""The models an organization offers on its own provider keys.

An organization's BYO provider key reaches every model its provider serves and
lists none of them, because catalog discovery dials ``config.providers``
instances only. This service is the other half: it asks the provider what the
stored credential reaches, records each model as offered, seeds a rate from the
community dataset so the model can actually be served, and carries the switch
that decides whether it is.

Three rules are worth stating once, because each is load-bearing and none is
obvious from a signature.

**A rate is written to ``organization_model_pricing``, never to
``model_pricing``.** The deployment price list carries no tenancy column, so one
row there prices the model for every organization on the deployment; a rate this
surface seeds belongs to the one organization whose credential pays for it. The
organization table is also the rung
``services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`` already consults first for a
request whose organization is known, so a rate seeded here is the rate those
requests settle at, with no second store to drift.

**``origin`` is what tells a seeded rate from a chosen one.** A row this service
wrote carries ``"seed"`` and a later refresh may move it to the day's default; a
row an admin edited through ``/organizations/me/pricing`` carries ``"api"`` and
a refresh leaves it alone forever. That is the whole provenance mechanism, and
it is why no timestamp column mirrors it.

**Disabled until priced.** A model no rate could be found for is recorded and
not served, so a model the pricing data has not caught up with cannot be billed
at nothing. The switch is also how a model is withdrawn: rows are disabled
rather than deleted, so the model, its rate and its history stay where an admin
can turn it back on.

No transaction is open across an upstream dial or across the thread hop that
resolves community defaults, both of which can take the whole discovery timeout.
