"""The login freeze: whether this deployment is refusing new dashboard sign-ins.

An operator turns this on to redeploy without anyone signing in mid-migration,
and off again when the deployment is back. It refuses *new* sessions only:
a session already minted keeps working, so the operator running the redeploy is
never locked out of the dashboard by the switch they just flipped.

**Why this is not a key in ``runtime_settings_service``**, whose table it does
share. That service exists to override a ``GatewayConfig`` field: every key in
its ``_SPECS`` names one, an override is applied by mutating this worker's
in-memory config, and its own docstring records that other workers pick a change
up "on their next startup, not live". Both halves are wrong for a freeze. There
is no config field to mutate, and a freeze that holds on the replica that served
the toggle while the other replicas keep signing people in is not a freeze. So
the flag is read from the stored row on every sign-in attempt instead. That read
is a single-row primary-key lookup against a request that already pays for a
bcrypt verification, which is several orders of magnitude more expensive.

``load_overrides`` skips any row whose key is not in ``_SPECS``, so this row is
invisible to that service and cannot be applied to the config by accident. The
value encoding ("true"/"false") is deliberately the same one it uses for a bool,
so the table holds one vocabulary rather than two.

**Every door has to close, and a scan is what keeps that true.** The freeze is
only as good as its least-remembered sign-in path, so
``tests/unit/test_maintenance_mode.py`` enumerates the routes that call
``create_dashboard_session`` and fails on one that neither checks this flag nor
declares why it closes no door. WebAuthn and OAuth (#651, #652) each end by
minting a session, so each will answer to it.

Nothing here touches the data plane. A frozen deployment still serves
``/v1/chat/completions`` and the rest of the management API to a caller
presenting the master key or an API key through the header; what stops is the
dashboard sign-in that mints a cookie. That boundary is what lets an operator
turn the freeze back off without signing in: ``PATCH /v1/settings/maintenance-mode``
is master-key gated and reachable through the header, which never passes through
the door the freeze closes. It does presuppose the operator still holds that key;
one who does not recovers by setting ``OTARI_MASTER_KEY`` and restarting.
