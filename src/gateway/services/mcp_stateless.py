"""Stateless, single-server MCP discovery and execution.

The primitive behind the stored-server endpoints in ``api/routes/mcp.py``, and
deliberately not :class:`~gateway.services.mcp_client.MCPClientPool`. The pool
exists to hold several sessions open across a model's whole tool loop and to
publish the union of their tools; these endpoints connect to exactly one server,
do exactly one thing, and close. An application pauses for a person between
discovery and execution, so nothing here may be kept alive across that wait.

The bounds are the point. A caller-orchestrated application hands Otari a tool
name and arguments a model proposed, and the remote server is untrusted: its
catalog can be unbounded, its schemas hostile, its response arbitrarily large.
Every ceiling in the design's limits table is enforced here or in the route, and
each is named in the constant that carries it.
