"""Streaming-aware MCP tool-use loop (OpenAI chat-completions format).

Wraps one or more `acompletion` calls so that when the model emits tool_calls
for tools owned by the MCPClientPool, the loop executes them against the MCP
servers, appends the assistant + tool result messages to the conversation, and
re-calls the provider for the next iteration. Tool calls for user-supplied
(non-MCP) tools end the loop and bubble up to the caller untouched.

Both streaming and non-streaming variants are provided. The streaming variant
yields `ChatCompletionChunk` objects across the entire loop as a single
`AsyncIterator`, which can be fed into the existing `streaming_generator`.

The format-agnostic loop skeleton lives in
:mod:`gateway.services._tool_loop`; this module supplies the chat-completions
strategy (wire-shape helpers, exit predicates, usage folding) and the public
wrappers the routes call.
