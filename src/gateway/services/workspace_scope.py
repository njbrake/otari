"""Which workspace a request-plane row belongs to.

Every row in ``api_keys``, ``usage_logs``, ``model_aliases``,
``routing_policies``, ``routing_memory``, ``router_preferences`` and
``file_objects`` carries a workspace, so every writer needs one. There are
only two sources:

- **An API key request.** The workspace comes off the key that authenticated it,
  never off a header. A caller controls its headers and not which key it holds,
  so reading a header here would let anyone bill another workspace.
- **A master-key request.** There is no key row, so it lands in the deployment's
  default workspace: the operator acting deployment-wide, which is what the
  master key means.

This id is not only a billing label. Since otari#643, it also decides *whose*
organization-scoped provider keys satisfy a bare ``provider:model`` selector
(one naming no ``config.providers`` instance) via
``services/provider_kwargs.get_provider_kwargs``: a keyed request resolves
through its own workspace's organization, and a **master-key** request
therefore resolves through the default workspace's organization, not through
every organization the deployment holds. An operator running several
organizations behind one gateway who calls a bare selector with the master
key gets the default workspace's key or none, the same as any other
deployment-wide write this module resolves.

The default is resolved per call and deliberately not memoized. ``RESTRICT``
looks like it makes a cached id safe, since a workspace holding request-plane
rows cannot be deleted, but it does not cover a default holding *nothing*, which
is deletable as soon as a second workspace exists. A process cache would then
hand every deployment-wide write an id naming no row, and one process clearing
its own cache does nothing for the other workers and replicas that also hold it.
The lookup it saves is two indexed reads on the master-key path, which is
operator traffic; keyed requests read the workspace straight off the key.
