"""Making an upstream provider message safe to hand back.

Lives in the service layer rather than beside its first caller in
``api/routes/_platform.py`` because it has a second one that cannot reach the
API layer: ``services/model_discovery_service`` renders the same class of text
(an any-llm exception from a provider call) into a provider health or test
response. ``scripts/check_architecture.py`` forbids a service importing
``gateway.api``, and a second copy of these patterns would be a copy that goes
stale, so the patterns live here and both callers import them from here.
