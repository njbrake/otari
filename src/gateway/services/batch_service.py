"""Persistence for batch jobs: ownership records and idempotent accounting.

The gateway stores one row per created batch (:class:`BatchRecord`). That record
is the durable anchor the route uses to enforce strict ownership and to bill and
log a completed batch's usage exactly once. Batches created before this table
existed carry no record; the route keeps the metadata-anchored fallback for them.
