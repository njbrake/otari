"""First-run master-key bootstrap.

When no master key is configured (no ``OTARI_MASTER_KEY`` / config value), the
gateway generates one on first launch, stores only its SHA-256 hash, and prints
the plaintext once so the operator can sign in to the dashboard. This makes
"launch with almost nothing" real without leaving the management API
unauthenticated: the generated key gates every management route exactly like an
operator-set one, and there is no unauthenticated setup route to race.

An operator-provided key always wins and is never generated over. The hash is
kept in the ``runtime_settings`` key/value table (the flag logic ignores keys it
does not know), so no new table is needed. The plaintext is never stored or
logged after the one-time banner.
