"""Provider-instance resolution and kwargs building from gateway configuration.

A request's model selector (``instance:model``) is resolved here into the
underlying any-llm implementation plus the credentials configured for that
instance. The instance name is an otari-level routing key: it is what pricing,
budgeting, and usage logs are keyed on, while the *implementation* is what
any-llm is actually dispatched against. When an instance name is itself a real
any-llm provider (the common case, no ``provider_type`` declared), the two
coincide and behavior is identical to splitting the selector directly.

``workspace_id`` does two unrelated jobs here, and it is worth keeping them
apart. It selects **which workspace's aliases and routing policies** the
selector is resolved against (``alias_service``, ``policy_store``), which
applies to every selector shape. Separately, it selects **whose
organization-scoped provider keys** may supply credentials (otari-ai#1748,
otari#643): a second, disjoint credential source, consulted only for a *bare*
``provider:model``/``provider/model`` selector, i.e. one with no matching
``config.providers`` instance. An ``instance:model`` selector always draws its
credentials from ``config.providers`` exactly as before and never touches
organization-scoped keys, by construction: the two addressing schemes occupy
disjoint selector shapes rather than one layering over the other. See
``services/tenancy/org_provider_key_service.py`` for the overlay this reads.

``workspace_id`` is per-request, not per-deployment: which organization's keys
a master-key request's bare selector can reach is the default workspace's
organization, not every organization the gateway holds. See
``services/workspace_scope.py`` for why a master-key request resolves to that
one workspace at all.
