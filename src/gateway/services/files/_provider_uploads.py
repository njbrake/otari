"""Short-lived copies of a stored upload at the provider that runs a request's code.

Otari's store stays the source of truth.
A copy carries an expiry the provider enforces, never outlives the file's own,
and is reused while it has enough life left for the request that finds it.
A provider that answers with a longer expiry than it was asked for has the copy
taken back, because the rule is about what exists rather than what was asked.

Each copy is reserved as a pending row before it is uploaded, confirmed once
the provider holds it, and canceled when it does not.
A copy whose upload or confirmation is cut off can be left unnamed, and the
provider expires it on its own.
