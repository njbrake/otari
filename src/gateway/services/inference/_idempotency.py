"""Deduplicate completion requests that carry an ``Idempotency-Key``.

A retry of a request whose response was lost (a dropped connection, a client
timeout) would otherwise call the provider again and be billed again. The first
request claims the key before it is dispatched; a retry with the same key and
body gets the stored response, or is told the original is still running, as
the IETF Idempotency-Key draft and Stripe's API do. Only a success is stored: a
failed request is refunded, so a retry of it runs again.

The stored body is the generated content, so it is encrypted with
``OTARI_SECRET_KEY``. A deployment without that key stores nothing, and a body
that no configured key can decrypt is treated as missing and runs again.
