"""URL safety checks for outbound HTTP fetches the gateway makes on behalf of a request.

Four call sites with overlapping but not identical threat models:

* **MCP server endpoints** (:func:`validate_mcp_url`) — URL comes from the
  request body. We block private/link-local/reserved IPs to prevent SSRF.
  Loopback is allowed by default (useful for same-host sidecar deployments)
  and gated by ``OTARI_MCP_ALLOW_LOOPBACK``. Also enforces TLS when a
  bearer token is supplied.

* **Guardrail definition endpoints** (:func:`validate_mcp_url` again, with a
  label of its own) — an organization admin writes them into a stored
  definition and a later step builds a vendor client from them, so the same
  private/link-local block applies. TLS is enforced unconditionally there,
  a definition holding a vendor credential beside its endpoint.

* **Web-search result URLs** (:func:`validate_outbound_fetch_url`) — URL
  comes from a third-party search engine via the configured search backend.
  Tighter defaults: loopback is blocked too (the gateway has no legitimate
  reason to fetch search results from itself). Gated by
  ``OTARI_WEB_SEARCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS`` for operators with unusual
  setups (private indexes etc.).

* **Provider ``api_base``** (:func:`validate_provider_api_base`): the URL is
  operator-supplied (master-key gated, standalone-only), the same trust level
  as a config.yml provider endpoint. This one defaults to *allow-all*: the
  home-lab / self-hosted use case depends on private-network endpoints
  (``localhost``, RFC 1918), so the check is off unless an operator opts in via
  ``OTARI_PROVIDER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=false``, at which point it blocks the
  same private/link-local/reserved ranges as the web-search path.

These checks are intentionally conservative: DNS rebinding can defeat host-based
allowlists. Production deployments should also enforce egress policy at the
network layer.
