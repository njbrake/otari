"""Operator mutations over imported usage rows: bulk delete and manual repricing.

The dashboard's usage tables let an operator clean up or correct *imported* usage
(rows brought in through ``POST /v1/usage/external-events``), the routine work that
otherwise needs direct DB access. Two operations are exposed:

- **delete**: drop a set of imported rows.
- **set-price**: recompute ``cost`` / ``billing_meters`` / ``pricing_breakdown`` from
  manual per-1M rates and each row's own token counts.

Both target the same set two ways: an explicit ``ids`` list (the current UI selection)
or a filter (for "everything matching this filter"). ``by_filter`` must be set
explicitly for the filter path so an empty request body can never match, and thus never
delete or reprice, every imported row by accident.

**Safety invariant:** every query is scoped to ``counts_toward_budget = False`` (imported
rows). Enforced gateway rows and the spend ledger (``users.spend``) are never touched, so
neither operation can desync a budget, matching the boundary the ingest path establishes.

    - :func:`not_served_here` is the provenance invariant: imported rows carry a
      source slug (e.g. ``claude_code``), while usage Otari served itself is tagged
      ``gateway`` (or ``otari-ai:gateway`` when it was backfilled from hosted
      history). This is the load-bearing guard, because ``counts_toward_budget``

      key (``exclude_from_budget``) is also ``counts_toward_budget = False``, and

      slug behind the legacy prefix, rather than the prefix itself, is what keeps a
      migrated import (``otari-ai:claude_code``) repriceable while a migrated hosted
      row is not; see :mod:`gateway.core.usage_source`.
    - ``counts_toward_budget = False`` is kept as a defense-in-depth budget guard, so
