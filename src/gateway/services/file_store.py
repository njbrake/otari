"""Pluggable blob storage for uploaded file bytes.

The ``/v1/files`` API stores file *metadata* in the database (see
``gateway.models.entities.FileObject``) and the raw *bytes* here, keyed by an
opaque ``storage_ref``. Keeping bytes out of the relational store lets large
uploads live on a filesystem / object store while the DB stays lean.

``put``/``get`` are the full-buffer path (kept for callers, like the content
normalizer, that need the whole blob in memory regardless). ``put_stream`` /
``get_stream`` let the upload and download routes move bytes chunk-by-chunk
instead of buffering an entire file, which is what actually bounds memory use
for concurrent large uploads (see issue #156).

Only a local-filesystem backend ships today; ``S3FileStore`` / ``GCSFileStore``
can implement the same :class:`FileStore` protocol without touching callers.
