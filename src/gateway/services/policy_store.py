"""Stored routing policies, held in a process-wide cache.

Why a cache rather than a query per request: policy lookup happens on the hot
path, and it also has to answer from synchronous call sites that have no database
session (the same constraint that shaped ``alias_service``, whose design this
follows). So rows are loaded into the process and refreshed on a timer.

Consequences worth stating plainly, because one of them is a security property:

* A newly written policy takes up to :data:`POLICY_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` to reach
  other workers and replicas. The worker that served the write refreshes
  immediately, so a single-process gateway is consistent at once.
* That window also applies to *removing* a candidate and to *attaching a
  mandatory guardrail*. For up to the TTL, other replicas keep serving the old
  plan. An operator tightening a policy for security reasons needs to know the
  change is eventually consistent, not immediate.

Layering: this sits alongside ``alias_service`` rather than inside
``services/routing/`` on purpose. The routing package depends on
``provider_kwargs`` (via ``model_access``) to resolve selectors, and
``provider_kwargs`` needs policy lookup to resolve a static policy name, so a
store inside that package would close an import cycle. Being a leaf peer keeps the
graph one-directional.

Scoping matches ``alias_service`` exactly, workspace included: a stored policy
belongs to one workspace and, within it, is either workspace-wide or scoped to
one user. A ``config.yml`` policy has no workspace and is in force in all of them. A lookup
that names no workspace reads the deployment's default, which is where a
deployment-wide write lands (``services/workspace_scope``).

A stored spec is validated on write and again on load. A row written by
a newer version whose schema this build does not understand is skipped with a
warning rather than crashing the loader, so one bad row cannot take routing down
for every other policy.
