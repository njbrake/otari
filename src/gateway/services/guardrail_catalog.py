"""The guardrail catalog behind the dashboard's mandate form.

A profile is not a name this repository knows. It is a key in the operator's own
``service.yaml`` on the guardrails service, which builds one guardrail per
entry at boot, so the set of profiles a deployment has is that service's to state
and never ours to guess. The catalog is therefore a join of two sources, neither
of them a list written here:

* **Which profiles exist**, from ``GET {guardrails_url}/profiles`` on the running
  service. It answers with each profile's name, the ``any_guardrail`` class it is
  built from, and the model id, if the operator pinned one.
* **What each one takes**, from ``any_guardrail.parameter_registry``, keyed by
  that class name. Upstream generates it from the guardrails' own signatures and
  docstrings and keeps it in a stdlib+pydantic leaf precisely so a consumer can
  render a configuration form without importing a model backend (any-guardrail
  #206). Nothing here constructs a guardrail; only the registry is read.

Of those profiles only ``validate``-stage parameters are published. The ``create``
stage is the guardrails service's constructor, fixed by the operator's YAML at boot,
so an organization that could set one would be storing a value nothing sends:
``POST /validate`` takes ``validate_kwargs`` and nothing else. That is the same reason
``extra_kwargs_for_creation`` has no column on an organization guardrail (see
`services/tenancy/organization_guardrail_service.py`).

A deployment whose service is down, unconfigured, or too old to publish
``/profiles`` gets a catalog marked unavailable with a reason rather than an
error. The form falls back to naming a profile by hand, which is the whole of
what it could do before this existed, so a guardrails outage must not also take
away the page that configures guardrails.

The built-in catalog
--------------------

Beside that sits a second, local catalog: the guardrails this gateway can run
itself, read straight from ``any_guardrail``'s import-free registry. Nothing is
joined and nothing is fetched, so there is no unavailable state to report. It
carries **both** stages, because a guardrail this gateway constructs itself has no
operator YAML fixing its constructor, and the create stage is where a vendor API
key lives. It carries the one-of requirement groups beside them, because a
constraint satisfied by any of several parameters is one no parameter's own
``required`` flag can state.

It is not every guardrail the library ships. A guardrail that works by holding
model weights in the process running it is not one this gateway builds, so it is
not one this catalog may offer; those belong in the guardrails service above, and
the two catalogs divide on exactly that line. The rule is upstream's own backend
taxonomy rather than a list kept here: a guardrail's ``backend``, which is the
one this gateway would get, and not its ``alternate_backends``, which name paths
nothing storable can select.
