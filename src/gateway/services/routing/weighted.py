"""The ``weighted`` router backend: split traffic across providers by weight.

A load balancer expressed as a routing policy. ``{router: weighted, candidates:
[...], weights: {...}}`` sends each request to one candidate drawn at random in
proportion to its weight, so two providers weighted 70 and 30 serve roughly that
share of the traffic. What it is for: spreading load across providers, holding a
second provider warm so a failover has somewhere to go, moving traffic onto a new
provider a few percent at a time, and draining one to zero without deleting it.

Three properties are worth stating because they are the reasons this is the
simplest correct design and not a placeholder for a smarter one:

* **Stateless.** Each request is an independent draw, so the split is exactly as
  correct behind twenty replicas as behind one. Unlike learned trace stickiness,
  it needs no cross-request decision store. The cost is that the ratio converges
  statistically: a ten-request burst is not necessarily seven and three.
* **No pricing needed by the router.** Unlike the kNN router, nothing here scores
  cost, so an unpriced candidate is neither refused at policy-write time nor a
  reason to decline the draw. Weight is the operator's statement about capacity,
  not a number the gateway derives. The gateway's own ``require_pricing`` billing
  gate is separate and unchanged: it still 402s a metered caller drawn onto an
  unpriced candidate, exactly as it would for that model named directly.
* **The whole ordering is the plan.** The draw continues without replacement over
  the candidates that were not picked, so a provider that fails before it has
  responded hands the request to another weighted provider (itself chosen by
  weight) before the policy's ``on_failure`` chain is reached. A provider that is
  failing therefore sheds its share to the others for free, without any health
  tracking.

Zero-weight candidates are not excluded from the plan, only from the draw: they
sit at its tail in declared order. That is what makes ``{a: 100, b: 0}`` a drain
rather than a deletion, and it is why the tail keeps a stable order instead of
being shuffled.

    reporting it as 30% would describe a split that is not happening.

    An all-zero pool reports the head taking everything, because that is what the
    draw does with it: :func:`weighted_ordering` has nothing to sample and keeps
    declared order, so the first candidate serves every request. Policy validation
    guarantees at least one positive weight, so this only happens when every
    weighted candidate was filtered out and the drained ones are all that is left.
