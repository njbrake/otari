"""kNN routing memory: the learned router backend.

Implements the premise that similar prompts behave similarly, so a
nearest-neighbor vote over one user's ``(embedding, {model: quality})`` records
can send each request to the cheapest candidate that is still good enough.

Scoring, per candidate ``m`` over the ``k`` nearest neighbors:

    score(m) = mean_quality(m | neighbors) - alpha * normalized_cost(m)

``alpha`` is the single cost-vs-quality dial and the highest score wins. Every
uncertain case declines instead of guessing (cold pool, sparse neighborhood,
sub-floor confidence, tool-bearing request, unpriced candidate), and a decline
serves the policy's default target, so a learned policy is never worse than the
plain failover policy it was written from.

The store is a linear cosine scan over the records the requesting user has in the
requesting workspace, held in the gateway DB
(:class:`gateway.models.routing.RoutingMemory`). That holds into the low
thousands of records per partition (the ``router_max_records_per_user`` cap,
which bounds one user's records in one workspace, since that is what a decision
loads); larger pools need an indexed vector store. Records carry an
``embedding_model`` tag so changing
the embedding model invalidates stale vectors rather than mixing incomparable
spaces.

Known v1 limits (tracked on #187): capability gating is minimal (a request
carrying tools keeps the default target; vision and context-window gating need a
capability registry), learning happens only through the preference API rather
than from live traffic, cost is list price rather than cache-aware, and the
router is standalone-only because hybrid mode resolves models upstream.

        Resolved through ``resolve_provider_selector`` rather than split by hand so
        the lookup keys on the same ``instance:model`` the request will be billed
        under. A candidate naming a provider *instance* would otherwise be priced
        against its implementation name and look unpriced.

        ``workspace_id`` decides *which model* the selector names, for the same
        reason it does in :meth:`_canonical`: an alias can point somewhere
        different per workspace, and pricing the default workspace's target while
        scoring this workspace's would rank on a price the request never pays.
        That is separate from *whose rates* apply, which the next paragraph is
        about and which this deliberately leaves alone.

        Deliberately reads the *deployment* price list, not an organization's rate
        overrides, so a router's ranking can differ from what the chosen request
        settles at. Three reasons it stays that way. This is a preference and not
        a charge, so nothing is billed wrong. ``decide_ordering`` carries no key
        and no session (``_candidate_prices`` opens its own), and the surface it
        shares with ``explain`` and the CLI is required to stay callable with no
        request at all, so an organization could only arrive by widening that
        boundary. And the refusal below cannot fire spuriously for an
        override-only price: ``unpriced_router_candidates`` validates a policy's
        candidates against the deployment list when the policy is written, so a
        candidate priced only by an override never becomes a stored policy.
