"""Compile a routing policy into an ordered plan of attempts.

Pure and synchronous. Everything it needs about the request arrives as arguments
(:class:`BudgetState` and the allow-list), so it takes no database session, is
trivially testable, and adds no queries of its own. The caller decides whether
the budget numbers are even worth fetching, via :func:`needs_budget_state`: a
plain failover policy has no conditions, so the common case costs zero extra
queries.

What it deliberately does **not** do:

* **No pricing lookups.** Pricing is one query per model, so checking every
  candidate would be an N+1 on the request path. The existing pricing gate keys on
  the selected head candidate exactly as it does for a plain model name, and the
  ``explain`` surface is where an operator sees an unpriced fallback before it
  matters.
* **No dispatch.** It returns candidates; the walker tries them.

Drops are values, not silence. Every candidate removed from the plan is recorded
in :attr:`CompiledPlan.dropped` with a reason, so the caller can log it, return it
from ``explain``, and record it on the usage row. A "failover" policy that
silently compiled down to one attempt is the failure mode this exists to prevent.
