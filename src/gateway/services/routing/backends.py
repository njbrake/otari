"""Router backends: the pluggable half of a routing policy's ``select``.

A policy entry ``{router: knn, candidates: [...]}`` names a backend here. The
backend ranks the candidates for one request and the compiler turns that ranking
into the plan; everything else about the policy (``on_failure``, the
allow-list, the caps) is unchanged, so a router is one decision inside a policy
rather than a second routing system.

There is deliberately no global on/off switch. The policy naming a backend is the
switch: routing cannot be turned on for a gateway behind an operator's back, and
two policies cannot disagree about whether it is on. An *unknown* backend name is
not an error either, on the same principle the compiler already applies to a
router that declines: routing is an optimization, so a policy naming a backend
this build does not have serves its default target and warns once.

* ``noop`` → :class:`NoOpRouterBackend`, which declines every request. Useful to
  hold a policy's shape while its pool is still being taught.
* ``knn`` → :class:`gateway.services.routing.knn.KnnRoutingMemory`, imported
  lazily so a gateway with no learned policy never loads the embedding path.
* ``weighted`` → :class:`gateway.services.routing.weighted.WeightedRouterBackend`,
  a load balancer: one candidate per request, drawn in proportion to the weights
  the policy declares.
