"""Run a policy's router backend for one request.

The bridge between the API layer, which knows the request, and a backend, which
knows how to rank models. Everything request-shaped arrives as a
:class:`RoutingSignal` of plain values, so this module (like the compiler) never
touches FastAPI, and a caller can simulate any request by constructing one.

The candidate pool is filtered *before* the backend sees it: a router that picked
a model the caller's allow-list forbids would have its choice dropped by the
compiler and silently serve something else, which reads as the router
misbehaving. Filtering first means the backend only ever ranks models this
request could actually use.

    every backend but one: kNN has no prompt to embed here, so the compiler falls
    through to the default target, and that decline path is what ``explain``
    documents.

    The weighted backend is the exception, because its split is written in the
    policy rather than derived from the request. So explain shows the real answer:
    candidates heaviest share first, with shares normalized over the pool that
    survived this caller's allow-list. Deliberately not a sample of the draw, which
    would make the same command print a different plan on every run.

    The *ordering* covers the whole declared pool, unlike the request path, which
    filters before ranking. Filtering here too would hand the compiler a pool with
    the forbidden candidates already gone, so they would never appear in
    :attr:`CompiledPlan.dropped` with their reason, and that list is most of the
    point of ``explain``: a balanced policy that compiles down to one provider for
    this caller is exactly what an operator needs to find before an outage does.

    That holds when *nothing* in the pool survives, which is the case the operator
    most needs to see. The shares are empty, because a split over no candidate is
    not a split, but the ordering still carries the declared pool so every filtered
    candidate is named in ``dropped``. Returning nothing here instead would compile
    the policy down to its ``on_failure`` chain with the whole split silently
    missing from both lists.
