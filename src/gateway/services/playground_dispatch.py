"""Running a Playground completion from a deployment that serves no inference.

A hosted control plane holds every tenant's wallet, credentials and budgets and
runs none of their traffic: a completion served here would skip the usage report
that debits the wallet, which is otari#822 and the reason the inference routers
are not mounted. The Playground still belongs on that deployment, because the
page is management traffic everywhere except for the one request that dispatches
a model, so this module is what that one request does instead.

It forwards. The route authenticates the session and resolves the same
:class:`~gateway.types.session_principal.SessionPrincipal` it resolves
standalone, and then, rather than calling the local pipeline, presents that
principal to ``config.data_plane_url`` as an ordinary API key and streams the
answer back. Nothing about routing, budgets, guardrails, tools, pricing or
settlement happens here: the data-plane gateway runs the pipeline and reports the
usage upstream, and that report is what debits the wallet. The billing path is
the one every other request on this deployment already takes.

**Why it has to be a real API key.** The wire between a control plane and its
gateway carries one (``docs/hybrid-mode-protocol.md``): the gateway forwards it
as ``X-User-Token`` and the control plane authenticates it on the way back. There
is no channel on which this deployment can simply assert who to bill, so the
credential has to be something the resolve path already accepts. The key carries
the caller's own user, workspace and model allow-list, so spend, budgets and the
allow-list gate bind exactly as they would for a key of theirs.

**Transport.** This hop carries a credential, so it belongs on a network the
operator controls or behind TLS. ``data_plane_url`` accepts ``http`` for the same
reason ``platform.base_url`` does, and deliberately: the two are one protocol's
two directions between the same pair of processes, and the reverse one carries
the caller's own API key. Holding this direction to https while that one accepts
plaintext would describe a boundary that is not there. otari#1295 settles the
pair together.

**Why it is stored, and why that is not otari-ai#1598 again.** This deployment
has to *present* the credential rather than merely verify one, which is the one
thing a hash cannot do, so the plaintext is encrypted at rest with the same
``secret_box`` that holds provider credentials. What #1598 retired was a bearer
handed to the *browser*; this one never leaves the process, is never returned by
any endpoint, and is excluded from the key listings because it is machinery
rather than a credential anybody manages. One row per caller per workspace,
reused, so a chat page does not mint a key per message.
