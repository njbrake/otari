"""Run a request's guardrails, against the guardrails service or in this process.

A profile is served one of two ways. Most are POSTed to the guardrails service
described below. A profile an organization mandated through a definition of its
own is answered by a guardrail this worker already built and holds, handed in as
``in_process`` and declared here as :class:`InProcessGuardrail`; nothing about it
leaves the process, and nothing in this module knows how one is built.

The guardrails service (``otari-anyguardrails-container``) wraps
`any-guardrail <https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-guardrail>`_ behind a small
HTTP API. The only endpoint we call is::

    POST /validate  {profile, input_text, validate_kwargs}
        → {profile, result: {valid, explanation, score}}

``result.valid is False`` means the guardrail flagged the input (e.g. the
``prompt-injection`` profile — Deepset in-process, or DuoGuard via an
encoderfile — detected a prompt injection).

Unlike the sandbox / web-search backends, this does **not** duck-type the MCP
tool-loop ``pool`` protocol: guardrails never enter the tool loop. It is a flat
pre-provider interceptor — see :func:`run_input_guardrails`, which the three
route handlers call right after auth and before dispatching to the provider.

The service URL is operator-controlled (``OTARI_GUARDRAILS_URL``); callers may
override it per-guardrail via :attr:`GuardrailConfig.url`, which is SSRF-checked
here in :func:`run_input_guardrails` (not at parse time: the check does a DNS
lookup that must be awaited, and Pydantic validators can't await — see
:mod:`gateway.models.guardrails`).

    """Run every input-direction guardrail and return the aggregate verdict.

    ``mandated`` names the profiles that came from a layer above the caller (an
    organization entry or a routing policy) rather than from the request body.
    It decides what an unsafe or unresolvable URL *means*, which is not the same
    question for the two sources: a caller who sent a bad URL sent a malformed
    request and is told so, while a mandated entry's URL is stored
    configuration the caller cannot see or fix, so failing to validate it is the
    guardrail being unevaluable and is governed by ``mode`` and
    ``on_unavailable`` like any other evaluation failure. Without this a
    transient DNS failure on an organization's endpoint refused every request
    from every workspace it was scoped to, including entries explicitly
    configured to fail open.

    ``credentials`` maps a profile name to the bearer credential its entry
    carries, and is populated only for guardrails an organization mandates
    (`services/tenancy/organization_guardrail_service.py`). It is a separate
    argument rather than a field on :class:`GuardrailConfig` because that model
    is parsed from the request body: a credential field there would be one a
    caller could set, which would turn the guardrail list into a way to make
    this gateway send a secret to an endpoint of the caller's choosing.

    ``in_process`` maps a profile to a guardrail this worker already holds,
    built from the organization's own definition
    (`services/tenancy/organization_guardrail_runner.py`). A profile in it is
    answered here and never sent anywhere, so its entry has no URL and reaches
    neither the safety check above nor the ``default_url`` fallback below. A
    value of ``None`` is a profile whose definition this worker holds nothing
    for, and is unevaluable rather than a reason to try the remote path.

    Only guardrails with ``"input"`` in :attr:`GuardrailConfig.on` are
    *evaluated* here (``"output"`` is accepted but not yet enforced — see the
    model docstring). Each guardrail's URL is ``cfg.url or default_url``.

    URL *safety* is checked for every entry in ``guardrails`` up front,
    regardless of direction — not narrowed to ``input_guardrails`` — so an
    output-direction guardrail's ``url`` override is SSRF-checked here too,
    even though it isn't evaluated yet. This intentionally preserves the
    coverage the removed parse-time Pydantic validator had (see
    :mod:`gateway.models.guardrails`): when output enforcement is built, its
    code path can assume a *caller's* URL was already validated instead of
    needing to remember to add the check itself. A ``mandated`` entry's failure
    is the exception, because it is not an outright rejection: it is held until
    the per-entry loop below reaches that profile, so an output-only mandate's
    failure has nowhere to land yet and is dropped. Output enforcement has to
    consume it the way the input loop does rather than assume it never happened.

    Failure handling depends on the guardrail's ``mode`` and its
    ``on_unavailable``:

    * ``block`` guardrails with ``on_unavailable="block"`` (the default) **fail
      closed** — if one can't be evaluated (service unreachable, no URL
      configured, malformed response) we raise
      :class:`GuardrailsNotReachableError` (the caller surfaces it as a 502)
      rather than let an unchecked request through.
    * ``block`` guardrails with ``on_unavailable="monitor"`` trade enforcement for
      availability: the check is recorded as inconclusive and the request
      proceeds, the same as a ``monitor`` guardrail. Only reachability is affected;
      a guardrail that runs and flags still blocks.
    * ``monitor`` guardrails **fail open** — they're observe-only, so an
      evaluation error is logged and recorded as an inconclusive result
      (``valid=None``) and the request proceeds; we don't 502 a request the
      caller explicitly asked us not to enforce.

    Returns:
        A :class:`GuardrailVerdict` aggregating every input guardrail's result.

    Raises:
        GuardrailsNotReachableError: if a ``block``-mode guardrail with
            ``on_unavailable="block"`` can't be evaluated.
