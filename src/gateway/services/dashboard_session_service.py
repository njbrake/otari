"""Dashboard sign-in sessions.

Signing in to the admin dashboard exchanges the master key for a server-issued
session: an opaque token handed to the browser in an HttpOnly cookie, with only
its SHA-256 hash stored in the ``dashboard_sessions`` table. This lets a
sign-in survive tab closes and browser restarts without ever persisting the
master key (or any JS-readable credential) in the browser.

Every session names the identity it was minted for, so it resolves a caller and
that caller's active organization rather than only proving the master key was
presented once. Master-key sign-in binds the session to the deployment's
bootstrap operator (`services.tenancy.provisioning_service`); a per-user sign-in
flow binds it to whoever authenticated.

An opaque token, deliberately, rather than the platform's JWT ``Token``: this
session is revocable server-side, which a bearer JWT is not, and the cookie,
HTTPS and rate-limit machinery around it already works. otari-ai#1716 settled
that sessions are the steady-state dashboard login, so the platform's JWT does
not survive the rehome (see ``docs/access-control.md``).

Sessions live in the database, not process memory, so every worker and replica
accepts them and a revocation is seen everywhere. They expire on a TTL
(``dashboard_session_ttl_hours``) and are revoked on sign-out, on master-key
rotation, when their identity is deactivated, and (through the foreign key) when
it is deleted.
