"""Runtime model aliases: storage-backed display names for real selectors.

An alias can come from two places. ``config.yml`` aliases are immutable at
runtime and validated at startup; ``model_aliases`` rows are writable through
``/v1/aliases``. Both mean the same thing to a request, so everything that
resolves or lists aliases reads them merged, via :func:`effective_aliases`.

A stored alias has two independent scopes. Its **workspace** says which tenant
owns it: an alias resolves only for requests in that workspace, which is what
lets two workspaces each define ``fast`` and get their own target. Within a
workspace, ``user_id`` scopes it further: ``NULL`` means every caller in that
workspace sees it, and a non-null ``user_id`` belongs to that user alone,
shadowing the workspace-wide row of the same name for them.

A ``config.yml`` alias has no workspace. It comes from a file the deployment
owns, so it is in force in every workspace, and it is never listed under one.

Precedence is most-specific-first, so ``user-scoped > config.yml > stored
workspace-wide``. The middle pair is the pre-existing rule (the API refuses to
store a workspace-wide alias shadowing a configured one, so it is a safety
net); the user-scoped layer sits on top of both, because overriding a shared name
for one user is the whole point of scoping it.

Resolution has to stay synchronous. ``resolve_provider_selector`` is called from
eleven places, including ``services/vision.py``, which has no database session
and no way to get one; making alias lookup async would mean threading a session
through the whole dispatch path. So stored aliases are held in a process-wide
cache, refreshed from the database rather than read per request. A write
refreshes its own worker immediately; other workers and replicas converge within
``ALIAS_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS``, which is the staleness window for a newly created
alias, not for anything already serving traffic.

The cache is keyed by workspace first, which is what made widening the table's
uniqueness constraint safe: while it was keyed on name alone, a second
workspace's ``fast`` silently shadowed the first at request time, so the
constraint could not allow one. A resolution that names no workspace falls back
to the deployment's default, matching ``services/workspace_scope``: a caller with
no workspace of its own (the master key, an operator-configured selector) is
acting deployment-wide, and the default workspace is where its writes land too.
