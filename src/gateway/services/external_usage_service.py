"""Ingest externally-observed usage events into the usage log.

Subscription-backed agents (e.g. Claude Code) never route through the gateway, so
their usage is invisible to Otari. This service accepts normalized, content-free
usage events, prices them at the rate effective for the event's own timestamp
(the importing workspace's organization override where it has one, otherwise the
deployment price list), and records them as ``usage_logs`` rows with a ``source``
provenance tag. Imported rows are attributed to a user and carry their real
(API-equivalent) cost, but are always ``counts_toward_budget=False``:
retrospective usage cannot be reserved, so it is recorded and shown in cost
analytics without ever gating or mutating ``users.spend``.

Idempotency: rows are keyed by ``(source, source_event_id)`` (a unique constraint).
Re-submitting a batch counts already-present events as duplicates and never creates
a second row. The endpoint accepts only metadata and numeric token counts; prompts,
completions, and tool payloads are rejected by the request schema, not stored.
