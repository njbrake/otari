"""Which provider offerings are the same model.

The catalog keys everything on a selector, ``instance:model``, and nothing in it
knows that ``fireworks:accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p3`` and
``nebius:zai-org/GLM-5.3`` are one model served twice. This module is that
knowledge: a pure function from what a provider calls a model to a grouping key,
and a vote over the group for the name and vendor to show.

Two rungs, and the order matters. models.dev's display ``name`` is the primary
key because its maintainers have already normalized the provider spellings
("GLM 5.3", "GLM-5.3" and "GLM5.3" all name one thing); the provider's own id is
the fallback, cleaned of the prefixes and suffixes that are about the serving
rather than the model. Measured over the whole models.dev catalog the id rung
agrees with the name rung on three entries in four, and the disagreements are
resellers whose names drop a size or date the id keeps, which is why it is the
fallback and not the rule.

The normalizer keeps digits and words and folds only punctuation and case, so a
dated build (``deepseek-v4-pro-0813``), a size or tier (``glm-5.3-flash``) and a
mode a reseller exposes as its own id stay separate models. Over-grouping would
put two prices under one header; under-grouping only costs a singleton, and the
raw selector is on every offering row, so a wrong group is never a wrong call.

No I/O and no configuration: everything here is decidable from the strings.
