"""Auto-discovery of models from configured providers with in-memory TTL caching.

One process-level cache backs all discovery consumers (``GET /v1/models``,
``GET /v1/models/discoverable``, and the stored-provider connection test). It
does three things that keep a broken or slow provider from turning into a storm
of upstream calls:

- **Positive caching**: a successful ``list_models`` result is reused for
  ``model_cache_ttl_seconds``.
- **Negative caching**: a *failure* is remembered for
  ``model_discovery_negative_ttl_seconds`` (shorter), so an unreachable provider
  is not re-dialed on every single request. Without this, failures are never
  cached and each request re-pays the provider's full timeout.
- **Single-flight**: concurrent callers for the same provider share one
  in-flight ``list_models`` call instead of each firing their own. This is what
  stops ``/v1/models`` and ``/v1/models/discoverable`` (both mounted on the
  dashboard's Models page) from doubling every fanout.
- **Background refresh**: while ``model_cache_ttl_seconds`` is above 0 a
  refresher task (``run_discovery_refresher``, wired in the lifespan) owns the
  dialing, and reads answer from the cache at any age (``serve_stale``). So the
  TTLs above describe when the *refresher* re-dials, not what a read waits for.
  The exceptions are a provider that has never been dialed, which the arriving
  read still dials so a cold worker does not claim the provider has no models,
  and ``model_cache_ttl_seconds = 0``, which turns the refresher off and puts
  every read back on the dialing path.
