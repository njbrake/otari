"""Per-request accounting for tools the gateway runs itself.

A gateway-run tool call (``otari_web_search`` → :class:`~gateway.services.web_search_backend.WebSearchBackend`,
``otari_code_execution`` → :class:`~gateway.services.sandbox_backend.SandboxBackend`,
or any MCP tool) costs the operator real money at a search provider, a sandbox,
or an MCP server, and until now none of it was recorded: the request's usage row
carried tokens only. :class:`ToolUsageTally` is the one place those calls are
counted, so settlement can price them onto the row that caused them.

One tally belongs to one request, never to a backend::

      route ──▶ ToolUsageTally() ──▶ backend(tally=…) ──▶ call_tool() ──▶ record
                      │
                      └──▶ settlement reads meters() ──▶ billing_meters["tools"]

Ownership matters because the streaming path tears the backend down while the
response is still being settled: ``_eager_backend_stream``'s ``finally`` runs as
the stream is exhausted, and ``streaming_generator`` only awaits ``on_complete``
afterwards. A tally stashed on the backend would be read after teardown.

Billable vs failed is decided on the ``[tool error]`` sentinel rather than on an
exception, because the backends disagree about which they use: ``MCPClientPool``
and ``SandboxBackend`` return the sentinel as a normal value, ``WebSearchBackend``
returns it for an empty query but raises ``WebSearchNotReachableError`` when the
backend is unreachable. A failed call is counted and never billed.
