"""Organization-scoped guardrail configuration: CRUD, and the request-path resolve.

The fourth and last of the config planes #655 asked about, and the only one whose
rows sit *above* the deployment rather than below it. ``guardrails_url`` stays a
deployment concern in ``runtime_settings`` (``routes/tool_settings.py``), request
handlers still run whatever a caller asks for, and a deployment that configures
no organization guardrails behaves exactly as it did (otari#654).

**What a row is.** One guardrail an organization mandates: a profile on the
guardrails service, an optional endpoint and credential of its own, the two
failure-handling modes a request-body entry already carries, and the switch that
decides whether it runs in every workspace of the organization or only in the
ones its scope names. At admission the rows in scope for the request's workspace
are merged into the effective guardrail list, exactly as a routing policy's
mandate already is, with the stricter setting winning on every axis.

**Why this stays inside the #655/#678 rule** even though it is a layer adding
configuration rather than narrowing one: a mandated guardrail can only make
fewer requests succeed, never more. That is also why an entry may carry a URL
and a credential where `workspace_code_execution_policy_service` may not. A
sandbox is a capability the tenant would be acquiring; a guardrail is a
restriction the tenant is accepting, and a caller can already point a
request-body guardrail at an endpoint of their own
(``models/guardrails.GuardrailConfig.url``), so nothing here is reachable that
was not reachable before.

**Composition with the layer below is org-controlled only.** There is no
workspace opt-in and no workspace opt-out: a veto would widen what succeeds
beyond what the organization permitted, which is the one thing #678 forbids. The
hosted plane's ``organization_guardrail_key_access`` row, with its three states
two of which mean off, therefore reduces here to plain membership.

**Deliberate divergences from otari-ai's ``OrganizationGuardrailKeyService``:**

- ``profile`` is unique per organization, where the hosted plane keys on a
  ``nickname`` so one profile may be configured twice. This request path merges
  guardrails by profile and always has, so a second row of one profile could
  never run; refusing it at the write beats losing it at admission.
- No ``key_source``. Platform-managed and platform-generated guardrail sources
  are commercial depth (otari-ai#1699); bring-your-own is the whole of the
  open-core shape, so the credential column is either set or it is not.
- An ``enabled`` flag on the row, which the hosted model has no equivalent of:
  an organization can stop a guardrail without losing the credential and the
  workspace list it took to set up.
- ``extra_kwargs_for_creation`` is dropped. This repository's guardrails service
  builds its guardrails at boot from the operator's own YAML, so creation kwargs
  are not ours to send; ``validate_kwargs`` is what ``POST /validate`` accepts.

    ``credential`` is never stored as sent: it is encrypted with

    sent to the endpoint as ``Authorization: Bearer`` when the guardrail runs,
    so it authenticates this gateway to the guardrails service the entry names.
    A guardrail *vendor's* own key is not this: the guardrails service builds

    A credential therefore requires ``url``. The deployment's ``guardrails_url``
