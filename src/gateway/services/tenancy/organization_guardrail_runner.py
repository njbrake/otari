"""The guardrails an organization defined, built once per worker and held ready.

The store next door (`organization_guardrail_definition_service`) says what each
check is. This builds it and holds it ready. The request path looks one up by id
through :func:`handle` and runs it (`services/guardrails.py`); nothing here reads
a request or decides what happens to one.

A write asks for two things beyond that. :func:`rebuild_definition` brings this
worker back in step with one row once the write has committed, and
:func:`build_state` says what this worker holds for a given version of a row, so
an admin is told "saved, but not running" rather than being left to find out
from a request that stopped being served.

It lives in this package, and not beside `services/guardrails.py`, because
`org_provider_key_service` here already does this exact job for provider keys: a
process-wide cache, a load at startup and a background refresher. A
`services/guardrails/` package would collide with the module that serves the
remote path, which stays a supported backend and is untouched.

**Three facts about any-guardrail drive the whole design.**

*One: ``create`` and ``evaluate`` are plain synchronous calls.* Both end in a
vendor HTTP request, and `watsonx_guardian` reaches the network inside ``create``
rather than only inside a check. Run either on the event loop and every other
request on this worker stops, so both go to a thread.

*Two: a thread cannot be cancelled.* A build or a check that outruns its deadline
runs to the end and its answer is dropped. Nothing waits on it, which is what
keeps this simple, and it is also why the pool is bounded rather than trusted to
drain: the bound is the backstop a cancellation cannot be.

*Three: ``asyncio.to_thread`` would share the process-wide default executor* with
`services/file_extractors`, so a burst of checks would stall file extraction as
collateral damage. This pool is its own, and small unless a deployment running
many organizations' guardrails raises `guardrail_thread_pool_size`.

**The cache is keyed on the definition, not on the profile an organization
mandates it under.** One definition mandated under three profiles is one entry
and one vendor client, which is the whole return on storing the two separately.

**A refresh is a diff, not a rebuild.** The provider overlay next door reloads
decrypted dictionaries, where this holds constructed vendor clients; rebuilding
all of them twice a minute per worker would do real I/O for nothing. Each entry
carries the row's ``updated_at``, which the column sets on every write, so a tick
builds only what moved or is missing and drops what is gone or disabled.

**There is no lazy build.** A definition this worker does not hold is disabled,
absent, or one that failed to build, and a request cannot tell those apart. A
build while a request waits is the thing the cache exists to prevent.

**A vendor exception's message never reaches a log line.** A vendor SDK
constructor raises whatever it likes and may echo the arguments it was handed,
which are the organization's credentials. What is logged is the guardrail class,
the definition id and the exception's type. Not the definition's name either: an
admin may have typed a credential into it by mistake. The one exception is
`ImportError`, whose text is upstream's own fixed install hint and the only
build failure an operator can act on.
