"""The dashboard's first-request setup guide, per workspace.

A workspace that has never served a request is a dashboard full of empty
panels, and the one thing an operator needs from it is a working call. This
service is the state behind the guide that walks them there: whether to offer
it at all, the API key it hands out, what the workspace's traffic says about
the attempt, and the dismissal that retires it.

Ported from the platform's ``WorkspaceActivationService``
(`otari-ai` `backend/app/services/workspace_activation_service.py`), with three
deliberate departures, each of which is a consequence of this edition rather
than a simplification:

- **Activation is derived, not recorded.** The platform stores the attempt
  telemetry in columns because its usage pipeline is asynchronous and crosses
  services, so it has no local row to read. Here the usage row is written by
  this process into this database, so the first successful gateway request in
  the workspace *is* the evidence, queried through the index the migration adds
  for it. Nothing to backfill, and nothing that can disagree with the Activity
  page.
- **Nothing is per-viewer.** The platform keys its state on the user, because
  activation there is a person's first request on a hosted account. A
  standalone deployment's guide is about the workspace, so the state is one row
  per workspace and dismissing it says "this workspace is set up" for everyone
  who can manage it.
- **No profile survey, and no analytics.** The platform's success screen
  carries a questionnaire whose answers exist to be mapped onto CRM properties,
  which is permanently hosted-only (otari-ai#1749), and its presentation counter
  feeds a product-analytics funnel this dashboard deliberately does not have.
  Neither crosses.

The guide never invents a credential quietly: issuing a key is a workspace
management action, authorized exactly like renaming the workspace, and the key
it mints is an ordinary ``api_keys`` row that shows up on the Keys page under
its own name.
