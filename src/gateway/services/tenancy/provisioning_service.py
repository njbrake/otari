"""First boot: the default organization, its workspace, and the operator identity.

Standalone Otari authenticates an operator with the master key, which proves
possession of a deployment-wide credential and names no user. Every tenancy
surface, on the other hand, reads off an identity with an active organization and
a role. This module is the bridge: the first master-key-authenticated request
provisions the default organization, its default workspace, and one owner
identity, and every later request resolves that same identity.

That is otari-ai#1716 option A: the master key is the bootstrap credential, and
it stops being the steady-state dashboard login once real sessions arrive. Two
things follow from being a bootstrap step rather than a login, and both are
deliberate:

- The operator identity has no email. It is an operator label, not a sign-in
  address, like the gateway's own spend identities, and the claim flow that gives
  such an identity an address is a separate track.
- It is a superuser. The master key already carries deployment-wide authority,
  so scoping the identity it maps to more narrowly would be theater.

The identity is anchored by a ``runtime_settings`` row rather than by the default
organization's slug: an operator may rename, leave, or delete that organization,
and the anchor has to survive all three.

    Provisioning adopts an organization whose slug is ``default``, which is the
    one it would have made itself. Anything else it would quietly ignore: it
    would create its own organization, point the marker at that, and every route
    is scoped to the marked identity's organization, so the rows already in the
    database become unreachable through the API. ``POST /v1/organizations/me/switch``
    is no way back either: it refuses an organization the caller holds no active
    membership in, and a freshly provisioned operator holds none in an imported
    one. The marker is deliberately not a settable key, so the only way back is
    editing ``runtime_settings`` by hand.

    That is the state a restored or imported tenancy arrives in, because the
    platform's slugs are ``{name}-{prefix}`` and never the literal ``default``.
    Failing here turns silent data loss into an error naming the fix.

    It also fires for a deployment that created organizations of its own
    (``POST /v1/organizations``) and then lost its marker, since those slugs are
    not ``default`` either. The refusal is still the right answer there: what it
    reports is that the deployment can no longer say which organization it
    serves, and the fix below is the same one.

    It catches one of the two orderings. The check runs only while the marker is
    unresolved, so it covers importing into a database this gateway has never
    served a tenancy request against. Importing *after* it has provisioned its
    own tenancy is not caught: the marker already resolves, so this never runs
    again, and the imported organizations are silently unreachable exactly as
    described above. The fix in both cases is two rows, not one: the marker names
    the identity, and that identity's ``active_organization_id`` names the
    organization served. An imported identity belongs to several organizations
    and its pointer holds whichever it was last active in, so moving the marker
    alone adopts whatever that happens to be. See "Adopting an existing tenancy"
    in ``docs/access-control.md``.

    Not a startup error either, despite reading like one: the only caller is
    ``ensure_bootstrap_identity``, which runs from the request dependency, so
    this surfaces as a failed tenancy request rather than a refusal to boot.
