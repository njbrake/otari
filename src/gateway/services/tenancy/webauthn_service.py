"""Passkey registration, sign-in, and the credential list a person manages.

WebAuthn in one paragraph, because the rest of this file assumes it. A passkey
is a key pair whose private half never leaves the authenticator (a laptop's
secure enclave, a phone, a hardware key). Registering one has the authenticator
generate the pair and hand back the public half; signing in has it sign a
server-chosen challenge with the private half. Nothing this deployment stores
can be used to sign in as anybody, which is the property that makes the table
worth having over ``user.hashed_password``.

**Verification is py_webauthn's, not ours.** Checking an attestation object and
an assertion signature means CBOR decoding, COSE key parsing, the flags byte,
the RP-ID hash, the counter and the client-data JSON, and each of those has a
way to be checked that looks right and is not. The library does that; this
module owns the parts that are this deployment's: which relying party it is,
where challenges live, which credentials belong to whom, and what a failure
tells the caller.

**Every ceremony is two calls, and the server owns what joins them.** The
options call issues a challenge and records it; the verify call spends it. The
challenge row is deleted as it is read, so an assertion replayed against a
captured challenge matches nothing. See `models.tenancy.WebAuthnChallenge` for
why that record is a table rather than a cookie or a dictionary.

**Sign-in here is usernameless.** ``begin_authentication`` publishes no
``allowCredentials`` list, so the browser offers whichever passkey it holds for
this relying party and the assertion names the credential that answered. Two
consequences, both deliberate: an unauthenticated caller cannot ask this
deployment which passkeys an address holds (the list would be exactly that
oracle), and a passkey signs a person in without them typing anything, which is
the whole affordance. The cost is that a credential registered on an
authenticator that cannot store discoverable credentials will not be offered;
registration asks for a discoverable one, so that is a property of old hardware
rather than of a normal passkey.

**A passkey never bootstraps an identity.** Registration is performed from
inside a session, so it only ever adds a credential to somebody who is already
here. There is no passkey signup: a deployment is claimed with the master key
and a password (`user_service`), and a passkey is something an identity adds
afterwards.

    the whole security property of a challenge, and a read-then-write cannot
    provide it: two requests replaying one assertion would both find the row,
    both verify, and both be handed a session. Deleting by primary key and
    reading what came back means exactly one of them gets the row, because the
    loser blocks on the winner's lock and then matches nothing. This is the same
    no-check-then-act rule the budget reservation follows, applied to a nonce.

    The delete is staged on the caller's transaction, so a verification that
