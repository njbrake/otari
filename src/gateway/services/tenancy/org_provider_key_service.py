"""Organization-scoped provider keys: CRUD, defaults, overrides, and the dispatch overlay.

Decided at otari-ai#1748: `org_provider_keys` and its two override
tables are the source of truth for organization-scoped BYO provider
credentials (see `gateway.models.provider_keys`). This module is kept
separate from `services/provider_store_service.py` on purpose, so that
module's config.yml-merge overlay for instance-keyed, deployment-global
credentials stays completely untouched: the two mechanisms are disjoint by
construction (see `services/provider_kwargs.py`), not layered on top of each
other.

**Authorization and CRUD** follow `organization_service.py`/
`workspace_service.py`'s conventions exactly: a `*_for_user` method resolves
the caller's organization or workspace and its own management-role check
before touching a row, and every route stays thin. Workspace resolution and
the workspace-management check both go through `services.tenancy.authorization`
directly (`resolve_visible_workspace`, `require_workspace_management_access`)
rather than through `WorkspaceService`, the same shared entry point
`WorkspaceBudgetDefaultService` uses and `WorkspaceService` itself delegates
to internally. Reading is open to any active member; every mutation on the
organization surface needs an organization owner/admin, and every mutation on
a workspace's override or model restrictions needs an organization
owner/admin *or* an owner/admin of that workspace.

**The dispatch overlay** mirrors `provider_store_service.py`'s shape one for
one: a module-global, process-wide cache refreshed on a TTL and immediately
on write, because the completion dispatch path is synchronous and holds no
database session (see `services/provider_kwargs.py`). The one real
difference is the cache's key: `provider_store_service` keys by instance name
alone, because a deployment has one credential per instance; this keys by
`(workspace_id, provider)`, because a workspace resolves to a *different*
key depending on that workspace's own pin, its organization's default, and
its organization's oldest key, in that order (`resolve_active_key`). One
global refresh reloads every organization in one pass rather than one query
per organization, per otari-ai#1748's second sub-question: the expected row
count (provider keys across a whole self-hosted deployment) stays small
enough that sharding the refresh by organization would add complexity for no
benefit.

    mismatch is one request, not a standing state), but a caller relying on a
