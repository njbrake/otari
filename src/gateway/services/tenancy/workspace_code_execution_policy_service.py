"""A workspace's policy over the deployment-wide code-execution sandbox.

The sandbox stays an operator concern, and a policy decides who may ask for code execution and within which limits.
A workspace row may veto and may refine, and it never grants.
``enabled=False`` refuses ``otari_code_execution`` for the workspace.
``max_iterations`` and ``exec_timeout_s`` can only lower what the request would otherwise get.
``default_purpose_hint`` applies only when the request names none.
``tools`` intersects the tool kinds the sandbox backend serves, and an empty result refuses the request.
``image`` may name only an image on the operator's allow-list, because a settable image is a supply-chain surface.
``executor`` pins who runs a provider-named code-execution declaration (``auto``, ``otari`` or ``provider``)
over the deployment default and the request's header. It is a choice rather than a narrowing, and it grants
no sandbox the deployment has not configured.
No row means no narrowing.
Reads and writes both require an owner or admin of the organization or of the workspace.
:func:`resolve_workspace_code_execution_policy` is a plain read with no identity, and the workspace comes from the key.
