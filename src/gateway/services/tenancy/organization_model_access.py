"""What a dashboard session may be shown of the model catalog.

``services/model_access`` answers this for an API key, off a stored column. A
session has no such column: its reach is decided by membership. The allow-list
here is produced in that module's own wire shape (canonical ``instance:model``
entries plus the ``instance:*`` wildcard) so ``is_model_allowed`` decides both. A
second matcher would let the catalog and the inference gate disagree about the
same model.

Two disjoint addressing schemes decide it, and the split is
``services/provider_kwargs``'s rather than this module's:

* A selector whose prefix names a ``config.providers`` instance draws its
  credentials from ``config.yml`` and never touches an organization's keys, so
  every workspace of every tenant may use it. Each configured instance
  contributes ``instance:*``.
* A bare ``provider:model`` selector resolves through the organization's own BYO
  keys for the request's workspace, so it contributes only where the caller has
  one. Where a workspace has no such key, a provider the hosted port serves
  contributes the models it advertises there, or ``provider:*`` when it
  advertises no roster.

An organization holding no BYO key still gets every configured instance, which on
a standalone deployment is the whole catalog.

The scope also answers one thing the allow-list cannot. Aliases and stored
policies are workspace-scoped rows, and the catalog reads them for a workspace
rather than filtering them by target, so a name in a workspace the caller may not
see would be listed even though every entry it resolves to is permitted. See
:attr:`SessionCatalogScope.reads_default_workspace`.
