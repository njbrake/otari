"""Workspaces and their members.

Rehomed from the platform's ``WorkspaceService``, converted to async, with the
same two-level authorization model:

- creating and deleting a workspace is an organization owner/admin action,
- managing a workspace's members and settings is open to an organization
  owner/admin *or* to an owner/admin of that workspace,
- reading is open to any member of the workspace, plus organization
  owners/admins, who see every workspace in the organization.

Dropped on arrival, each with its own slice to arrive in: mixpanel tracking,
per-member budget-policy materialization, and the Playground token anchor. Their absence is why creation is a plain
two-row insert here.
