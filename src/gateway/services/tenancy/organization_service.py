"""This module resolves a caller's active organization and manages organizations and their members.

A method that acts for a caller never trusts an organization that the request names.
It acts in the caller's active organization, or in one it reaches through the caller's own membership.
An ID that names another tenant's row answers not-found, so a caller cannot probe which IDs exist.

A deployment can hold more than one organization.
Creating, listing and switching organizations therefore belong here rather than in an overlay.
The service offers no way to delete an organization, because historical attribution resolves through its rows.

        """Create an identity for an address nobody has added, with a tenant of its own.

        The self-serve half of signup (otari-ai#2100), reached only where
        ``open_signup`` is on: an address an admin already put on the roster is
        claimed by ``user_service.create_user_for_signup`` instead and nothing
        here runs. The rows are the ones every other identity on the deployment
        holds, which is the point: an account that arrived this way is not a
        second kind of member, so nothing downstream has to ask how it got here.

        The sibling of ``create_organization_for_user`` with the order reversed.
        That one has a caller already and creates an organization for them; this
        one has an address and no identity yet, and ``User.active_organization_id``
        is not nullable, so the organization is created first and stamped with
        its creator once the identity exists. No role check for the same reason
        that one gives, and a stronger one: there is no organization to hold a
        role in until this returns.

        **Flushes and does not commit**, unlike every other write on this
        service. The caller is mid-unit-of-work: signup hashes a password and
        mints a verification token onto the row this returns, and an account
        committed here without them would be a live, password-less,
        unverifiable identity if the rest of that call failed.

        The slug carries ``_generated_slug``'s random suffix, so two people
        registering under the same name do not collide and the organization can
        never be mistaken for first boot's ``default``.
