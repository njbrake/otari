"""A workspace's configuration over the deployment-wide web-search backend.

The backend is an operator concern and stays one: ``web_search_url`` names it,
and any credential belongs to the adapter sitting in front of it, so nothing
here can point a workspace somewhere else. What a row decides is *who on this
deployment may search, and how far their searches may reach*.

Composition follows the rule in ``src/gateway/AGENTS.md`` (#655, settled in
#678): a workspace row may veto and may refine, never grant. So

* ``enabled=False`` refuses ``otari_web_search`` for the workspace;
* ``max_results`` is floored against what the request would otherwise get,
  which is the request's own value or, failing that, the deployment's, so a
  workspace ceiling can only shrink a search;
* ``blocked_domains`` is *added* to the request's own block-list, and
  ``allowed_domains`` is *intersected* with the request's, so neither list can
  be shed by a request that sends one of its own;
* ``purpose_hint`` fills in only when the request named none;
* and **no row means no narrowing**, which is what makes a deployment that
  configures nothing behave exactly as it did.

That parts company with the hybrid path in ``prepare_gateway_tools``, which
treats the policy it resolves from otari.ai as a set of *defaults* a request
overrides. The precedence there is the platform's own contract and is left
alone; the rule above is this repository's, and it is the stricter of the two:
under default-only precedence a request could shed a workspace's block-list
simply by sending a block-list of its own, which is a guardrail that fails open.

``provider_options`` is the one field that keeps the hybrid precedence, merged
per key with the request winning. It is an opaque bag forwarded to the backend
adapter rather than something this gateway enforces, so there is no narrowing
relation between two values of it to apply.

The CRUD half is master-key routed (``routes/workspace_web_search.py``) and
role-gated per workspace: an organization owner/admin, or an owner/admin of the
workspace itself, may read *and* write it. Reads are gated for the same reason
``workspace_code_execution_policy_service`` gates them: the row is the
workspace's posture, not one member's allowance. It is looser than the hosted
service, which admits organization owners/admins only, because
``authorization.require_workspace_management_access`` is the gate every other
per-workspace surface in this repository uses.

The request-path half is :func:`resolve_workspace_web_search_config` plus the
pure :func:`narrow_web_search_tool_entry`, neither of which takes an identity:
the caller has already authenticated, and the workspace comes off the key,
never off a header (``services/workspace_scope``).
