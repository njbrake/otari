"""A workspace's limits on the deployment-wide web search backend.

The backend is an operator concern and stays one, so nothing here can point a workspace somewhere else.
A workspace's policy decides who on this deployment may search, and how far their searches may reach.

A policy may veto and may narrow, and it never grants.
:func:`narrow_web_search_tool_entry` narrows one Search declaration:

* ``max_results`` is floored against what the request would otherwise get,
  which is the request's own value or the deployment's default.
* ``blocked_domains`` is added to the request's own block-list.
* ``allowed_domains`` is intersected with the request's by domain suffix,
  and a request whose list overlaps the workspace's nowhere is refused.
* ``purpose_hint`` fills in only when the request named none.

``provider_options`` is merged per key with the request winning.
It is an opaque mapping of backend options, so no narrowing relation holds between two values of it.

Reading or writing a stored policy requires an owner or admin of the workspace or of its organization.
Reads are gated as well as writes, because the row is the workspace's posture and not one member's allowance.

:func:`resolve_workspace_web_search_config` reads a stored row.
:func:`read_web_search_policy` reads a control plane's answer.
None of them takes an identity, because the workspace comes from the authenticated key.

        gets `PendingRollbackError` from the next statement instead of the error
        that actually happened.
