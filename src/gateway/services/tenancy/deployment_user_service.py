"""Deployment-wide account administration, for whoever operates the deployment.

Every other identity surface in this tree is scoped to one organization: the
workspace roster, the organization's Members & roles page, and the invitation
flow all read through a membership and cannot see past it. That is right for a
tenant and leaves an operator with nothing. Before this module the only
deployment-wide concepts were the ``is_superuser`` flag and the
``tenancy_bootstrap_user_id`` marker, neither of which had an API, so the
recourse for a stuck or abusive account was SQL (mozilla-ai/otari#797).

Four operations: list every identity, deactivate or reactivate one, flip its
``is_superuser`` flag, and generate a password for one, which is how a deployment
that sends no mail gets a member signed in. Creating and inviting stay
with the organization surface, which is where the membership that makes an
identity useful is created, and deleting is not here at all for the reason
``routes/organizations.py`` gives about deleting an organization: historical
attribution resolves through rows that hang off the identity.

**Who may reach it.** A superuser, or the identity the ``tenancy_bootstrap_user_id``
marker names. The second is not redundant with the first even though provisioning
makes the bootstrap operator a superuser: the marker is what still admits an
operator whose flag was cleared, by hand or by another operator, and it is the
reason this surface cannot lock a deployment out of itself. Everyone else is
refused with 404 rather than 403; see
:class:`~gateway.services.tenancy.errors.DeploymentAdministrationUnavailableError`
for why the status is the one it is.

**What it refuses.** Two lockout guards, both narrow and both directional, so a
repair is still possible where a foot-gun is not:

- an operator may not deactivate *themselves* or clear their *own* superuser
  flag: the first ends the session they are holding, the second takes away the
  page it was done from, and neither leaves anything there to undo it;
- neither may be turned off on the bootstrap operator, because master-key
  sign-in mints a session for that identity and ``resolve_dashboard_session``
  refuses a deactivated one, so deactivating it turns the deployment's fallback
  credential into a session that dies on arrival.

Turning either flag *on* is unguarded in both cases, which is what makes
granting yourself back a cleared flag, or reactivating the bootstrap identity,
something an operator can still do here.
