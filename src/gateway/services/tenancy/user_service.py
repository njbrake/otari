"""Password sign-in, signup, and email verification and reset for the reconciled
control plane's identities.

Ported from the platform's ``user_service`` (``authenticate``,
``update_password``, ``create_user_for_signup``, ``verify_email``,
``resend_verification_email``, and the recover/reset password pair, the last
two of which live in the platform's ``login.py`` route rather than its service),
which is where the shape of this comes from. What it is *for* here is narrower,
and settled by mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716: the master key bootstraps a standalone
deployment and stays its deployment-wide API credential, while a password
against a `gateway.services.dashboard_session_service` session becomes the
steady-state dashboard login. Retiring a login is not retiring a credential, so
nothing here touches what authenticates ``/v1/keys``, ``/v1/users``, or the rest
of the management surface.

Departures from the port, each for a reason that belongs to this edition:

- **Sign-in failures collapse into one error.** See ``InvalidCredentialsError``.
  An unverified email is the one exception, and only once the password has
  already checked out: see ``EmailNotVerifiedError``.
- **A password can be set without proving the old one, by the master key.** That
  is the claim path and the recovery path in one, and it is not a weakening: a
  caller holding the master key can already do anything the management API can
  do, so asking them for a password they have forgotten would only lock the
  dashboard while leaving the API wide open.
- **A deactivated identity does not authenticate.** The platform's
  ``authenticate`` does not check ``is_active``; this one does, so deactivating
  someone ends their access now rather than when their cookie expires, which is
  the rule ``resolve_dashboard_session`` already follows.
- **Signup only ever claims an identity that already exists.** The platform's
  ``create_user_for_signup`` always inserts a new user into a brand-new
  organization; a standalone deployment is one tenant with several people in
  it (`organization_service`'s own docstring), so this edition's signup
  completes an identity `organization_service.create_active_organization_member_for_user`
  or ``invite_active_organization_member_for_user`` already put on the roster,
  password-less. An address nobody has touched is refused rather than
  onboarded from nothing.
- **Verification and reset tokens are opaque and hashed at rest, not JWTs.**
  ``gateway.services.tenancy.tokens`` mirrors the shape
  ``organization_service`` already uses for an invitation token: a random
  token handed to the caller once, only its SHA-256 hash stored, an explicit
  expiry column, and single-use enforced by clearing both to ``NULL`` on
  success. The platform's password-reset token is a stateless JWT with no
  persisted record of it, which means it can be replayed any number of times
  until it expires; this port closes that gap rather than carrying it over.

An identity with an address and no password is the normal state for someone an
admin added to the roster (`organization_service`); ``create_user_for_signup``
below is what gives it a way to sign in.

    owns that gate (`gateway.api.routes.auth_password`); this function does not
    re-derive it, and must not be called from anywhere that has not applied it.

    ``email`` claims a sign-in address for an identity that has none, which is
    the state first boot leaves the operator in. It is refused if another
    identity already holds it, because the column is unique and the address is
    the handle sign-in matches on.

    ``email_verified_at`` is stamped when this call is the one that makes the
    identity able to sign in at all: a first password, or a newly supplied
    address. Both are reachable only through deployment authority, which is what
    the stamp records, and both are what the module docstring promises #650 will
    find already satisfied. It deliberately covers the identity adopted from an
    existing tenancy (`docs/access-control.md`), which arrives *with* an address,
    so a claim on it supplies no ``email`` and would otherwise leave the column
    NULL and that operator locked out the day #650 turns the gate on. A later
    password change stamps nothing: proving the current password says the caller
    owns the account, not the address.

    Every other session this identity holds is revoked, ``keep_session_token_hash``
    excepted, so a stolen cookie does not outlive the password it was minted
    under. The caller passes its own session's hash to stay signed in; a
    header-authenticated caller passes nothing and every session ends.

    Any outstanding verification or reset token this identity holds is cleared
    the same way: whichever channel just proved deployment authority over the
    account (a claim, an operator recovery, or a proven current password
    through ``update_password``) is a stronger proof than a bearer link sent to
    an inbox, and a token minted before this change has no reason to survive
    it. Without this, a reset link generated and then overtaken by a password
    change elsewhere (the operator recovers the account before the link is

    default and the single-tenant posture, this only ever completes an identity
    an admin already added or invited by address (password-less, per
    ``organization_service``'s own docstrings) and creates nothing from nothing,
    because on a deployment with one tenant anybody who can reach the dashboard
    could otherwise join it. On, an address nobody has added is registered
    instead, with an organization and workspace of its own
    (``OrganizationService.provision_signup_tenancy``), which is how a control
    plane serving many tenants takes its first member of each.

    Enumeration-safe the same way ``resend_verification_email`` and
    ``request_password_reset`` are, and the setting does not change that: an
    address that already has a password and one whose identity has been
    deactivated return with nothing written and nothing mailed, whichever way it
    is set, and an unknown address is either registered or ignored in silence.
    The response never distinguishes them. Deactivation is
    checked here for the reason ``verify_email`` and ``reset_password`` already
    check it: it has to close every road in, and without this an identity
    deactivated before it ever signed up could still have a password set and a
    live verification token minted on it, waiting to become usable the moment
    an operator reactivated it. An earlier version of this call answered the
    three cases with distinguishable 404/409/200 statuses, which let an
    unauthenticated caller enumerate an organization's roster and signup
    progress, exactly what the sibling functions were already written to
    avoid; this closes that gap. ``password`` is still validated and reported
    on its own shape (too short, too long) before the lookup, since a policy
    violation says nothing about whether the address exists and checking it
    first means a bad password answers the same way whether or not the
    address is real.

    Returns the identity that was claimed or registered, or ``None`` on every
    enumeration-safe path, so a caller can tell the two apart without the
    response doing so. That is what lets the route notify ``GrowthSignalPort`` of
    a genuine signup and stay silent otherwise.

    Refuses before writing anything if this deployment cannot mail the
    verification link: a signup that could never be verified would strand the
    caller in the unverified, hard-blocked state #650's sign-in gate enforces.
    The mail send after commit is not guarded by a ``try`` on purpose, the same
    reason ``organization_service.invite_active_organization_member_for_user``
    does not guard its own: ``Mailer.send`` never raises, so the account this
    call creates is durable whether or not the message actually goes out.

    This is what "the deployment has been claimed" means, and it is the switch

    still accepted as a dashboard login, and once it is True that login is
    retired and the master key is an API credential only (otari-ai#1716). Read
    off the identity rather than a settings row recording the claim, so it
    cannot disagree with whether that password sign-in could actually succeed.

    Scoped to the one identity the master key resolves to, and not to "does any
    row hold a password" (#702). The two answer the same on a deployment whose
    only writer of ``hashed_password`` is the operator claiming it, and come
    apart in both directions once anything else writes that column:

    - A member who completes signup or a reset would otherwise retire an
      operator's dashboard login by an act of their own, on a deployment the
      operator never claimed, with no UI path back in (the way back is the
      master key against ``PUT /v1/auth/password``).
    - Identities arriving from the platform carry a password already
      (otari-ai#1644's backfill), so a re-parented deployment would otherwise
      read as claimed on first boot and ask the operator, at the sign-in
      screen, for credentials they do not have.

    No marked identity is not claimed: first boot has not run, so the master
    key is the only credential there is.
