"""An organization's own definitions of the guardrails this gateway runs itself.

The mandate next door (`organization_guardrail_service`) says *where* a check
runs and how hard it bites. A definition says *what* the check is: which of the
guardrails `services/guardrail_catalog` lists to construct, and the arguments to
construct it with. So an organization can define a check rather than only name a
profile some service already serves, and it does that the way it adds a provider
key: pick from a catalog, fill typed fields, paste the vendor credential.

**This module only writes the rows.** Building each one into a vendor client is
the runner's job (`organization_guardrail_runner`), and running one is
`services/guardrails`'. What lands here is the store and its rules.

**A write commits first and builds afterwards, never the other way round.** The
row is the truth and the runner holds a copy of it, so a vendor that will not
answer must not roll back a definition the form already accepted. What the build
did is reported on the response instead.

**It reports the build anyway, and does not import the runner to do it.** A read
of a definition answers two questions at once, what was saved and whether it is
running, and the second belongs to the runner. The runner already imports this
module, for the one function that undoes the secret split, so importing it back
would close a cycle. The composition root passes the two functions in instead
(`api/deps.py`), which is also what lets a test say what a worker holds without
one.

**Almost every rule is read off the catalog.** A list of guardrails, arguments
or credentials written in this module could only ever drift from the picker it
exists to accept, and the drift would surface as a row the form offered and
nothing can build. So `builtin_guardrail_spec` is the single derivation, and the
two rules it cannot give say at their own sites why: whose credentials a Bedrock
row would spend (`_refuse_bedrock_without_keys`), and which stored values are
addresses this gateway would dial (`_dialable_urls`, which reads the value
because upstream types every URL as a plain string).

**Secrets are split by the catalog's ``secret`` flag**, not by the shape of a
name: the plain values go to ``create_kwargs`` and every secret into one
encrypted map. The guardrails disagree about how many credentials they need
(Bedrock three, watsonx two, most one, some none), so a column each would chase
every guardrail upstream adds. ``create_kwargs`` comes back in clear on purpose,
the secrets having already been taken out of it by flag, and the form has to
round-trip an endpoint and a project id.

**This service holds no session.** Its queries are the repository's, its commits
are the Unit of Work's blocks, and the one thing it reaches for by session is
the role gate, which it receives already built. `OrganizationService` is still
in the old shape, and that seam is where it shows.
