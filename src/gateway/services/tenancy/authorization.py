    not part of that rule (see the module docstring). It is meant to be the one

    that method; keep the two in agreement until that is unified.

    ``workspace_ids`` is ``None`` for the whole organization rather than a list of
    every workspace in it, so the caller can express that as a predicate over
    ``organization_id`` and not an ``IN`` list that grows with the tenant. An
    *empty* list is a real answer and not an error: a member who belongs to no
    workspace yet may see nothing, which is an empty page rather than a refusal.
