"""Workspace-scoped MCP server configuration: CRUD, and the request-path resolve.

Ported from otari-ai's `MCPServerService` (otari#658). The platform stores an
MCP server per workspace, encrypts its bearer token on save, decrypts it when
the gateway asks for it by id, and never returns it in a public response. This
module is the same thing against the local database, for a standalone
deployment that has no platform to ask.

**Where it plugs in.** A request names stored servers with `mcp_server_ids`.
A deployment that holds the rows resolves them here, through
:func:`resolve_workspace_mcp_servers`, called at admission where the request's session is live and
`RequestContext.workspace_id` already names the workspace its key belongs to.
That is the seam otari#655 settled and otari#678 wrote down; MCP is the
exception that decision names, because there is no deployment-wide server list
for a workspace row to narrow, so a row here is the only source of the
configuration rather than a narrowing of one.

**Deliberate divergences from the platform's version**, all of them because a
standalone deployment is not a hosted multi-tenant one:

- Authorization is this repository's own workspace check
  (`services.tenancy.authorization`), so a workspace owner/admin qualifies and
  not only an organization owner/admin. Every *write* is management-gated,
  because these rows decide which external endpoints the gateway connects to
  and authenticates against on the workspace's behalf. The list read is not
  (otari-ai#1942): those endpoints act on every request a member sends through
  the workspace, so seeing them is a member's to do, and a reader who cannot
  manage the workspace gets any credential in the URL masked.
- URL safety is one check in this layer rather than the platform's split
  between a synchronous ingress validator and a service-layer SSRF pass. This
  repository's `validate_mcp_url` is a single async function that already does
  both, and these routes are async, so the reason for the split does not apply.
- No analytics events, and no `status` field on the public shape (the
  platform's is an affordance of its hosted dashboard; the page here,
  `web/src/features/tools/McpServersPage.tsx`, reports `enabled` and
  `has_token` and needs no third state).
