"""Email-domain claims, their DNS proof, and the sign-in that acts on them.

Rehomed from the platform's ``OrganizationDomainService`` plus the auto-join
half of ``OrganizationMembershipService``, converted to async. It is one module
rather than two because the two halves only make sense against each other: the
verification rule exists to decide what auto-join is allowed to act on, and
reading the claim surface without the sign-in it feeds makes the DNS proof look
like decoration.

**What the DNS proof is for.** Anyone may claim any domain here, so the claim
alone is worth nothing: without a proof, an organization could name a
competitor's domain and collect everyone who signs in with an address there.
Publishing a TXT record at the domain's apex is the check that the claimant
controls it, and until that lands, ``verified_at`` is null and auto-join skips
the row entirely.

**Claiming is not exclusive; proving is.** Any number of organizations may hold
an unproven claim on one domain, and proving it displaces the rest. Making the
claim itself exclusive is the obvious design and it is a trap: creating an
organization needs no privilege, so first-come-first-served on claims would let
anyone permanently lock a domain's real owner out of claiming it, with a 409
that cannot say who to ask.

**A proof expires.** ``verified_at`` records when the evidence was taken, and
``DOMAIN_PROOF_TTL`` is how long it is trusted. Domains change hands; a stamp
kept forever would go on admitting whoever owns the domain next, at a role this
organization picked. Past the TTL the claim admits nobody until an admin
re-verifies, which fails closed and needs no background sweeper. Re-checking DNS
on the sign-in path was the alternative and is worse: a 5s outbound lookup in
front of somebody waiting to sign in.

**Why auto-join runs at sign-in rather than at signup.** Verifying a domain has
to sweep in the accounts that already existed, which is the ordinary case: an
admin claims their company's domain on a deployment their colleagues already
use. Running on every sign-in gets that for free and stays correct when a claim
is enabled, disabled or re-verified later, at the cost of one indexed lookup per
sign-in.
