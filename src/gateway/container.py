"""Composition root: the one place that names a concrete adapter.

The container is a process-level registry of ``Port -> factory`` bindings,
built once per app in ``create_app`` and read per request through
``gateway.api.deps``. It is a plain mapping, deliberately not a
dependency-injection framework and not entry-point auto-discovery: only a
handful of ports ever need swapping, and only at startup, so the whole wiring
is readable in this one file and there is no install-time magic to trace
(``ARCHITECTURE.md``, "How a port is resolved").

Every port is bound here to a working core adapter, real or Null Object, so
Otari runs with no overlay present and behaves as it does today. Only real
ports belong here. A plain, single-implementation service stays wired directly
as an ordinary FastAPI dependency; routing one through the container would
claim a swap point that does not exist.

An overlay rebinds ports without editing any Otari source file, by pointing
``OTARI_BOOTSTRAP`` at a ``module:callable`` selector. The callable receives
this container after the core defaults are bound, and may rebind any port and
contribute routers of its own. Unset, the defaults stand.
