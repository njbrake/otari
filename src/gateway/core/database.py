    and no ORM ``relationship()`` is declared anywhere, so nothing the caller
    already loaded is reloaded afterwards.

    Returns whether the transaction was committed. A failure is not raised: the
    caller is about to reach the provider, and losing a request that passed
    every gate because the connection could not be handed back early is the
    worse outcome. The session is rolled back in that case, because a failed
