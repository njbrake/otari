"""Internal usage carrier that extends the provider usage shape with cache counts.

The provider-neutral usage object that flows through the request pipeline is
``any_llm``'s :class:`CompletionUsage` (the OpenAI shape). It exposes a single
``prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`` read slot and has no representation for a
cache *write* (creation) charge, which Anthropic bills separately.

:class:`GatewayUsage` subclasses ``CompletionUsage`` so it remains type-compatible
with every signature that already accepts a ``CompletionUsage`` while carrying two
explicit integers: ``cache_read_tokens`` and ``cache_write_tokens``. Capturing these
as plain integers (rather than relying on ``prompt_tokens_details``) lets the report
builder forward them uniformly across providers, including Anthropic cache writes.
