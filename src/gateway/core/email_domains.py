"""Email domains: the apex an address belongs to, and whether one may be claimed.

Beside `core.addresses` and for the same reason: an organization claiming a
domain (`services.tenancy.organization_domain_service`) and a sign-in matching
one (`services.tenancy.organization_service`) have to agree on what the domain
of an address *is*, and a disagreement between them is not a cosmetic one. The
claim is stored once and matched on every sign-in afterwards, so a normalizer
that differs by a trailing dot or a case fold would store a claim that never
matches, or match one it should not.

    Both normalizers below run this, which is the whole point: a claim and a
    sign-in have to land on the same spelling. Without it the two disagree
    exactly where it is hardest to see. ``münchen.de`` fails the ASCII-only
    shape check, so an admin retypes it as ``xn--mnchen-3ya.de``, which is
    claimable and provable by DNS; every colleague then signs in at
    ``münchen.de``, which normalizes to itself and matches nothing. The result
    is a claim shown as verified and active that admits nobody, with no error
    raised anywhere to explain it.

    **IDNA2008 (``idna``), not the standard library's ``str.encode("idna")``.**
    That codec implements IDNA2003, whose mapping step folds ``ß`` to ``ss`` and
    final sigma to sigma, so ``faß.de`` and ``fass.de`` both arrive as
    ``fass.de``. Those are two registrable domains owned by two different
    people, and collapsing them means proving one admits addresses at the other:
    the DNS proof would no longer bind to the domain it was taken from, which is
    the single guarantee this feature rests on. ``uts46=True`` keeps the case
    folding and normalization a typed claim needs; ``transitional=False`` is
    what holds ``ß`` apart from ``ss``.

    A value the library refuses (an empty label, a leading hyphen, an over-long
    label) is returned unchanged rather than raised on. For a claim,
    ``is_registrable_domain`` rejects it a moment later with a message about the
    domain; for a sign-in it simply matches nothing, which is what an
    unclaimable domain should do.
