"""Deployment-owned inference credentials for a request that brings none.

The seam between the core and whichever build serves a request that carries no
BYO provider key. A caller's own stored key never reaches this port: resolving
one is identical in every build, so it stays a plain, unseamed lookup upstream
of here. Only what happens when there is no BYO key varies, and hosted
inference (a metered fleet the deployment owns and proxies to) is the "core
port + hosted adapter" row of ``ARCHITECTURE.md``'s capability lines.

Self-hosting is a first-class path *upstream* of this port, not behind it: a
deployment pointing at its own backends resolves a credential the ordinary way
and never asks here. So the core adapter answers "unavailable" for every
candidate by design rather than by omission, and an overlay binds an adapter
that resolves against the upstreams it owns.

Stability: this interface is not frozen while Otari is pre-1.0. Overlay authors
should pin a released tag and expect the shape to move.
