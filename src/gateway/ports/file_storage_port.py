"""Where the raw bytes behind an uploaded file are kept.

The seam between an upload and whatever holds its blob.
A file's metadata stays in this deployment's database and only the bytes cross
here, keyed by an opaque ``storage_ref`` the store itself mints, so a large
upload can live on a filesystem or an object store while the relational store
stays lean.
The port owns no search: nothing above it asks the store to find a file, only
to hold one, hand it back and drop it.

The same bytes move in two shapes.
``put`` and ``get`` are the full-buffer pair, for a caller that needs the whole
blob in memory regardless.
``put_stream`` and ``get_stream`` move it chunk by chunk, which is what bounds
memory while several large uploads are in flight at once.
An adapter implements both pairs.

Storage failures cross as the ``OSError`` family, with ``FileNotFoundError``
for a blob that is not there, so an adapter over a remote store translates its
own client's exceptions before they reach a caller.
A malformed ``storage_ref`` is a ``ValueError`` instead, because a ref that
escapes the store's root is a caller error rather than a storage failure.

An adapter reaches its backend through ``asyncio.to_thread`` rather than an
AnyIO primitive. ``delete`` runs while a cancellation unwinds, and an AnyIO
checkpoint inside a cancelled scope raises before the backend is reached.

Stability: this interface is not frozen while Otari is pre-1.0.
Overlay authors should pin a released tag and expect the shape to move.
