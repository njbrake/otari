"""Core adapter for ``ModelProviderPort``: no hosted-inference fleet.

Satisfies :class:`gateway.ports.model_provider_port.ModelProviderPort` with
Otari's own answer: there is no fleet here to proxy to. Every candidate that
reaches this adapter has already failed the caller's BYO-credential lookup, and
a deployment pointing at its own backends resolves a credential the ordinary
way well upstream of this port, so what remains is genuinely unserved and this
adapter's whole contract is saying so. An overlay binds a hosted-inference
adapter behind the same port.
