"""Identity adapter enforcing the base build's roster policy on an OAuth sign-in.

Satisfies :class:`gateway.ports.identity_provider_port.IdentityProviderPort` with
the policy Otari's base build already applies to every other way in: an account
exists here because an operator put it here. A social identity signs in as an
account already on the roster and never creates one, so enabling Google or GitHub
sign-in widens *how* a member authenticates, never *who* may.

This is a real implementation and not a Null Object, per ``ARCHITECTURE.md``'s
cardinal property. There is a live decision behind the port (link, refuse, and
whether the provider's assertion is enough to lift the local verification gate),
and it is the decision an overlay is most likely to want to replace: a hosted
edition provisions on first sight, and an enterprise edition maps a directory
connection onto an organization. Both bind here without editing this tree.

    Holds the request's session because resolving is a database read and, on the

    the transaction, so the link and the verification stamp land with the session
    row that sign-in mints, or with neither.

    Constructible with no session, like every other core adapter, because the
    container builds one per request whether or not the request will use it. It

        The provider's assertion is what this trusts, and it must be an
        assertion: an address the provider returned but would not vouch for is
        refused before any lookup, so an unverified or merely unasserted address
        never selects a row. Refusing first also keeps the refusal from
        depending on whether that address happens to be on the roster.

        Two writes, both conditional and neither committed here:

        - The provider is recorded on an identity that had none, which is what
          "linking" means on this schema. An identity that already names a
          different provider is *not* rewritten: a second provider vouching for
          the same address still signs the same person in, and the column keeps
          the provider that arrived first.

          "First" is enforced rather than hoped for. Both writes below are
          read-then-write on a row with no unique index to lose to, so two
          sign-ins racing on one identity with two *different* providers could
          otherwise both see NULL and the later commit would win. The row is
          locked before either is decided, which is the shape otari#729 settled
          for verification and reset redemption on this same table.

          PostgreSQL only, per ``UserRepository.lock``: ``FOR UPDATE`` is a
          no-op on SQLite. The consequence there is which of two provider names
          lands in a column this edition never reads, so it is a documented
          limit rather than a reason to serialize differently.
        - A provider-verified address stamps ``email_verified_at`` if it is
          unset, which lifts the local sign-in gate the password path enforces
          (``user_service.authenticate``). That is not a shortcut around
          verification, it is a stronger proof of the same fact than this
          gateway's own mail loop produces, and it is the one way a deployment
          that cannot send mail can still let a member in.

        Raises:
            OAuthEmailNotVerifiedError: If the provider returned no address, or
                one it does not affirmatively vouch for.
            OAuthIdentityUnknownError: If no active identity here holds that
