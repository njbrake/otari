"""``CodeExecutionPort`` over E2B, a hosted sandbox provider.

The second implementation the port exists for. A deployment that cannot run
the reference container with the isolation untrusted code needs, a PaaS with
no privileged containers for instance, sets ``sandbox_provider: e2b`` and needs
no sandbox service of its own.

A session is one E2B sandbox and the session id is the sandbox's own, so this
adapter holds no state between calls: any worker can serve any session, a kept
sandbox is resumed by that id from any worker, and one nothing releases is
reclaimed by E2B's own lifetime timer.

The SDK is an optional extra (``e2b``) imported inside
:meth:`E2BCodeExecutionAdapter.open_session`, so a deployment that does not use
it neither installs it nor pays for the import, and the OSS smoke gate keeps
passing with no dev dependencies.
