"""The code-execution wire contract, as the gateway consumes it.

Otari does not run code itself: it drives a code-execution backend over the
contract specified in ``docs/code-execution-protocol.md``. These are the
response shapes the gateway reads, so ``SandboxBackend`` parses a validated
object instead of walking untyped dicts.

Only the fields the gateway actually reads are modelled. The contract's
extension policy says a backend may return additional fields and a consumer
must ignore the ones it does not recognize, so unknown keys are dropped rather
than rejected, and the spec doc (not this module) is the full contract.

The same policy is why these models are liberal about the values they accept.
A field the gateway only renders absorbs a null or an unusable shape and keeps
going, because a payload that carries usable output must not be discarded over
a stream the backend chose to serialize as `null`. Validation is reserved for
the parts the gateway cannot proceed without: it fails on a missing session id
or a missing result payload, not on a cosmetic field.

The types live here, not next to ``services/sandbox_backend``, because they are
leaf types with no service dependencies, and ``check_architecture.py`` keeps
that direction one-way.
