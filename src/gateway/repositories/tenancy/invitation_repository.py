        The invitee-side counterpart to ``get_pending_by_organization_members``,
        which answers the roster's question ("which of these members have an
        invitation out") rather than the inbox's ("which organizations are
        waiting on me"). Joined in one query, so a row arrives with the
        organization's name and the role on offer instead of a lookup per row.

        Filtered on ``expires_at`` rather than on ``status`` alone, because
        expiry is lazy: ``_resolve_pending_invitation`` only flips a row to
        ``expired`` when someone presents its token, so an unopened link sits
        ``pending`` with its deadline already past. Filtering here rather than
        in the service is what keeps ``count`` and the page boundaries honest,
        which dropping lapsed rows after the fact would not.

        Both sides of the pair are checked, not just the invitation: a
        membership that has since been suspended (revoked, or removed outright)
        keeps its cancelled invitation queryable, and only a membership still
        ``invited`` has an accept that would mean anything.

        ``id`` breaks the ``created_at`` tie for the reason
        ``get_by_user_with_organizations`` gives: two rows written in one
        transaction share a timestamp, and a page whose order is not total can
        return one row twice and another never.
