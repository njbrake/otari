        Mirrors ``OrganizationRepository.lock``: a writer that reads several of
        a workspace's own rows, decides something from their combined state,
        and writes based on that decision needs the whole read-decide-write
        sequence to run as if serialized, which no single row's unique index
        can enforce on its own. Several independent races share this lock:

        - "At most one pinned provider-key override per workspace+provider"
          spans a variable set of override rows, one per candidate key.
        - A budget default's creation reads the workspace's current members
          before materializing, and a concurrent membership-creation path
          reads the workspace's current defaults before materializing the new
          member; without a shared lock both transactions can run their read
          before either commits its write, and the member who joined right
          around the default's creation gets neither's ceiling. Every
          membership-creation path (``WorkspaceService.create_workspace``
          excepted, since a just-created workspace has no default that could
          race it) takes this same lock before its own read, so the two either
          serialize or, for ``create_workspace``, never overlap.
        - A workspace's deletion reads its memberships before announcing them,
          and a membership created after that read rides the delete cascade
          while the ceiling keyed on it survives.
        - A workspace's deletion sweeps the ceilings keyed on the workspace and
          on its memberships, and a ceiling created directly on either scope
          after that sweep outlives the workspace.

        ``FOR UPDATE`` is a no-op on SQLite, which admits one writer at a time
        for the whole database anyway; PostgreSQL is where this is
        load-bearing.
