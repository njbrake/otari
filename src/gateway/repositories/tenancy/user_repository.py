        A standalone operator is an operator-defined label rather than a
        sign-in address, so the row is stored with no email by default; the
        nullable column tolerates that where a create schema requiring an address
        would not. Any gateway users a future convergence brings onto this table
        (otari-ai#1727) are the same shape. An identity an admin adds by address carries it from the start, as
        the handle the claim flow will match on, but it is unverified and grants
        nothing until that flow exists.

        ``is_active`` is a parameter rather than a constant because the M5
        in-place upgrade needs it: the reconciliation spec maps a soft-deleted
        gateway user onto a deactivated identity so its history stays
        resolvable, and the platform's own backfill passes
        ``is_active=row.deleted_at is None`` for exactly that. A helper that can
        only produce active rows cannot carry out that migration.

        ``default_organization_id`` is stamped with the same organization, and
        that is a **deliberate divergence**, not parity. The platform stamps it
        on its signup paths but not in its own ``create_local_identity``, so its
        re-parenting backfill leaves it NULL. Stamping is the safer default
        here: the hosted edition resolves an identity's offered-credit owner
        through that column and reads NULL as nobody, so an unstamped identity
        silently forfeits the anchor the column exists to hold, and nothing in
        this edition reads it to notice. The cost is that the two editions
        disagree on this column for identically-shaped rows, which belongs in
        the reconciliation ledger rather than being found during a cutover.
