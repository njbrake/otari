"""Data access for an organization's own rates, and the deployment list beneath them.

Serves the surface that offers models on an organization's provider key, which
needs to say what each offered model currently costs and to move the rates it
seeded itself. Reads only the two lower rungs of
`services.pricing_service.find_model_pricing`'s ladder; the genai-prices
fallback is not a table and is resolved by that module.

Built on the Unit of Work. Flushes, never commits.
