# Configuration

Otari reads a YAML file, environment variables, and selected settings stored by
the management API. Start with [`config.example.yml`](../config.example.yml);
the running dashboard's Settings page shows the effective non-secret scalar
configuration and which values can be changed without a restart.

## Config file

Pass a file explicitly:

```bash
otari serve --config config.yml
```

A small standalone configuration looks like this:

```yaml
database_url: "postgresql://otari:otari@postgres:5432/otari"
master_key: ${OTARI_MASTER_KEY}
default_pricing: true

providers:
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

String values support `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation. Keep credentials in the
environment or a secret store rather than committing them to YAML.

## Environment variables

Every scalar `GatewayConfig` field can be overridden as
`OTARI_<UPPERCASE_FIELD>`, for example:

```bash
export OTARI_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://otari:otari@localhost:5432/otari"
export OTARI_MASTER_KEY="..."
export OTARI_DEFAULT_PRICING=true
```

Provider SDKs also read their native credential variables, including
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, and
`GEMINI_API_KEY`.

Booleans accept `true`, `false`, `1`, `0`, `yes`, `no`, `on`, and
`off`, without regard to case.

### Full config via environment

Container platforms can supply the whole YAML document through
`OTARI_CONFIG_YAML`, or its base64-encoded form through `OTARI_CONFIG_B64`.
Use only one; raw YAML wins when both are present.

```bash
export OTARI_CONFIG_YAML='
default_pricing: true
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
'
```

Precedence from lowest to highest is the config file, structured environment
config, then scalar `OTARI_<FIELD>` values. Stored runtime settings override
the corresponding startup value after the database is available.

## Common settings

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `database_url` | SQLite or PostgreSQL connection. PostgreSQL is recommended for production. |
| `master_key` | Deployment-wide management credential. |
| `host`, `port` | Server bind address. |
| `auto_migrate` | Apply Alembic migrations at startup. |
| `require_pricing` | Reject unpriced, budgeted traffic. Defaults to `true`. |
| `default_pricing` | Use the bundled genai-prices catalog when no stored price exists. |
| `pricing_refresh` | What a scheduled genai-prices check does with an update: `manual`, `review`, or `auto`. |
| `public_catalog` | Serve the model catalog to visitors without a session. Defaults to `false`. |
| `public_catalog_rate_limit_per_minute` | Anonymous catalog reads per client address per minute. Defaults to 60. |
| `rate_limit_rpm` | Per-user request limit. Unset disables it. |
| `enable_metrics` | Serve Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`. |
| `enable_docs` | Serve OpenAPI, Swagger UI, and ReDoc. |
| `mode` | `standalone`, `hosted`, or `hybrid`. See [Modes](modes.md). |

For every field, its current default, validation, and description live on
`GatewayConfig` in `src/gateway/core/config.py`. Operators can read the
non-secret effective set through `GET /api/v1/settings`.

### Database connections

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `db_pool_size`, `db_max_overflow` | Connections available for serving requests. |
| `db_pool_timeout` | Seconds a request waits for a free connection before it is refused. |
| `db_pool_recycle` | Retire a connection after this many seconds. `-1` disables. |
| `db_connect_timeout` | Seconds to wait for a new connection to be established. |
| `db_command_timeout` | Client-side ceiling on one statement. `0` disables. |
| `db_statement_timeout_ms` | Server-side ceiling on one statement, the backstop for the setting above. Must exceed it; `0` disables. |
| `db_lock_timeout_ms` | How long a statement waits for a lock another transaction holds. Must be below the statement ceiling; `0` disables. |
| `db_log_pool_size` | Connections reserved for usage logging, separate from the pool above. |
| `db_ingest_pool_size` | Connections telemetry ingest may use, separate from the pool above and with no overflow. |

The pool sizes bound concurrent *database* work, not concurrent provider calls:
a request hands its connection back before the upstream call. Raise them for a
deployment whose dashboard and management traffic are heavy, not because
inference is.

Recycling and the two statement timeouts matter most behind a managed database
or a NAT, which drop idle connections without closing them. The pool's pre-ping
would catch a closed connection, but the ping is itself a statement and blocks
on a socket that went away silently, so leaving these unset turns a dropped
connection into a request that hangs for minutes.

`db_lock_timeout_ms` bounds a different wait. A statement queued behind another
transaction's lock is not slow, and the two ceilings above cannot tell the
difference: without a lock timeout it holds its pooled connection until one of
them fires, and the requests needing a connection wait for the whole of it. The
contended write fails in seconds instead, for a caller that can retry it.

`db_ingest_pool_size` is what keeps a telemetry import off that critical path.
The OTLP endpoints and `POST /api/v1/usage/external-events` draw from it rather
than the request pool, so a burst of imports contending on the same events
cannot take the connections sign-in and the dashboard need. It has no overflow,
which is the point: the cap is the isolation.

`db_command_timeout` is enforced client-side and `db_statement_timeout_ms`
server-side, so the second one still ends a statement when the client is the
stuck half. Configure the server-side value above the client-side one, which
the defaults do and startup validation requires: set equal, whichever fires
first is a race.

## Provider configuration

The `providers` map is keyed by provider instance. A standard provider needs
only its credential:

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```

A custom or self-hosted endpoint can use a named instance:

```yaml
providers:
  home_lab:
    provider_type: openai
    api_base: "https://models.example.com/v1"
    api_key: ${HOME_LAB_TOKEN}
    models: [qwen3-32b]
```

Call it as `home_lab:qwen3-32b`. The optional `models` list supplies discovery
for backends without a model-listing endpoint. See [Models](models.md).

### Session affinity

Some backends only reuse a cached prompt prefix when related requests land on
the same replica. Baseten routes on an `x-session-affinity` header, and an
instance can opt into sending it:

```yaml
providers:
  baseten:
    provider_type: openai
    api_base: "https://inference.baseten.co/v1"
    api_key: ${BASETEN_API_KEY}
    session_affinity: true
```

When a request carries `prompt_cache_key`, Otari sends the key's scoped form
(hashed with the caller's identity, as it already is before reaching any
provider) as the header value. The caller's raw key is never sent, and a request
without a key sends no header. It applies on `/api/v1/messages`, `/api/v1/chat/completions`
and `/api/v1/responses`, streaming included, and to each candidate of a routing
policy according to that candidate's own instance. The header is set on the
provider SDK client, so the flag is accepted only on an `openai` or `anthropic`
instance (including the `-compatible` forms); startup refuses it elsewhere.

A provider stored through the Providers page sets the same flag with its
**Session affinity** checkbox, which the page offers only where it applies, or
with `session_affinity` on `/api/v1/provider-credentials`, which refuses it on any
other provider type. A stored entry replaces
a config-file entry of the same name, flag included.

### Runtime provider management

Standalone operators can store provider credentials through the Providers page
or `/api/v1/provider-credentials`. Stored entries override config-file entries with
the same instance name. Config-file entries remain read-only in the dashboard.

Stored credentials require `OTARI_SECRET_KEY`, a Fernet key generated with
`otari gen-secret-key`. To rotate it, configure the new key before the old key,
run the provider and search-tool re-encryption endpoints, then remove the old
key. Losing every configured encryption key makes stored credentials
unrecoverable.

## Pricing

Pricing keys use `provider:model` or `instance:model`:

```yaml
pricing:
  openai:gpt-5:
    input_price_per_million: 1.25
    output_price_per_million: 10.00
```

Config-file prices seed the database. Prices stored through `/api/v1/pricing` take
precedence. Rates and settled costs use decimal arithmetic and costs are rounded
once to a micro-dollar. Use PostgreSQL for durable accounting.

### Default pricing

`default_pricing: true` enables a bundled genai-prices snapshot when no stored
price exists. Explicit database or config pricing always wins. The dashboard can
review and accept newer snapshots.

Default pricing is off because provider catalogs and reseller rates change.
With `require_pricing: true`, a budgeted request with no effective price is
rejected instead of bypassing the budget.

### Keeping the defaults current

`pricing_refresh` decides what the gateway does with a newer genai-prices
snapshot on its own:

- `manual` (the default) never fetches. An operator checks for updates on Model
  pricing and accepts or rejects what it finds.
- `review` fetches every `pricing_refresh_interval_seconds` (default one day,
  minimum five minutes) and holds a changed snapshot for review. Model pricing
  shows the pending update; nothing is metered differently until an operator
  accepts it.
- `auto` fetches on the same schedule and applies a changed snapshot at once.

Rejecting a pending update means "not now": nothing remembers what was
rejected, so the next check re-offers the same update while upstream still
differs from what is active. One worker performs each check, whichever claims
the tick first, so a deployment running several does not fetch or accept an
update once per worker.

Every accepted snapshot is recorded with who accepted it, `operator` or
`schedule`, and how many models it priced; `GET /api/v1/pricing/snapshots` lists
the history, which keeps the newest thirty. `GET /api/v1/pricing/drift` puts every stored deployment rate beside
the default it shadows, so a config-file price that has fallen behind the
provider's list is visible before it costs anyone. Both are operator reads, and
`pricing_refresh` can be changed at runtime through `PATCH /api/v1/settings`.

Each stored rate also carries its `unit` (`tokens`, `requests`, or `images`)
and its `origin` (`config` or `api`), so a rate the config file re-seeds on
every restart is distinguishable from one set in the dashboard.

### A public catalog

`public_catalog: true` serves `GET /api/v1/catalog/models` and the dashboard's
Models page to a visitor with no credential, so a deployment can show what it
serves before anyone signs up. A visitor sees the configured `providers:`
instances only, priced at the deployment's rates, and never an organization's
override, key-scoped allow-list, or usage. A caller who sends a credential is
served as that caller, valid or not. The setting is off by default, off in
hybrid mode, and can be changed at runtime.

Anonymous reads are throttled per client address by
`public_catalog_rate_limit_per_minute`, sixty a minute by default and its own
budget: `rate_limit_rpm` keys on an authenticated user and covers no anonymous
path, and `dashboard_login_rate_limit_per_minute` is sized for password
attempts, not for browsing. Set it to `null` to remove the limit.

Two limits of that throttle are worth knowing before a catalog is put on the
open internet. The address is the socket's, and the bundled server is started
without proxy headers, so behind a reverse proxy every visitor shares the
proxy's address and one scraper exhausts the budget for everyone; put the
throttle in the proxy instead. And the counter is per worker, so a deployment
running N workers serves up to N times the configured number.

In hosted mode a visitor sees the same thing a visitor sees anywhere else: the
process-wide `providers:` instances, which in that mode are the deployment's
own rather than any tenant's, priced at the deployment's rates. No
organization's providers, overrides, or usage are public, whatever the flag is
set to.

The instance names `otari` and `hosted` are reserved for a managed platform's
own offerings and are refused in `providers:`.

### Cache and tiered pricing

Optional cache fields reprice cached input when a provider reports it:

- `cache_read_price_per_million`
- `cache_write_price_per_million`
- `cache_write_1h_price_per_million`

Use `pricing_tiers` for a rate that applies to an entire request after an input
token threshold. The OpenAPI pricing schemas and dashboard editor show the
accepted shape.

### Per-request pricing (audio and moderations)

Audio, moderations, and direct search do not use token pricing. They reuse
`input_price_per_million` as USD per million requests. An unpriced request on
these endpoints is served at zero cost.

### Per-image pricing (image generation)

Image generation uses `input_price_per_million` as raw USD per image, without
million-unit scaling. Image generation is subject to `require_pricing` and
reserves the requested image count before dispatch.

These overloaded units are retained for schema compatibility. Do not apply a
token price to a request-priced or image-priced endpoint.

## Search tools

`search_tools` configures direct `POST /api/v1/search` calls. The same entries can
be managed at runtime from Tools or `/api/v1/search-tools`.

```yaml
search_tools:
  local:
    provider: searxng
    api_base: "http://searxng:8080"
```

`GET /api/v1/search-tools/providers` publishes the supported providers and whether
each requires an `api_key` or `api_base`. Provider options and request filters
are covered in [Built-in tools](tools.md). A tool carrying an `api_key` must use
an HTTPS `api_base`; a keyless local SearXNG endpoint may use HTTP.

## Mail

Mail is optional. Invitations still return an accept link when no transport is
configured.

SMTP needs the deployment's public URL, a host, and a sender:

```yaml
public_base_url: "https://otari.example.com"
mail_transport: smtp
smtp_host: "smtp.example.com"
smtp_port: 587
smtp_tls: true
mail_from_email: "otari@example.com"
smtp_user: ${SMTP_USER}
smtp_password: ${SMTP_PASSWORD}
```

`mail_transport: console` writes complete messages to logs for local testing.
Those messages can contain invitation or password-reset tokens, so never use it
where logs are shared. Test delivery from Settings or
`POST /api/v1/settings/mail/test`.

## Signup

Signup is closed by default: only an address an owner or admin already added or
invited can set a password. Open it where the deployment serves many tenants and
each new address should arrive with an organization of its own:

```yaml
open_signup: true
```

Mail has to be configured for either posture, since signup sends a verification
link. See [Access control](access-control.md) for what each posture does with an
address nobody has added.

## Built-in tools and guardrails variables

The Tools pages and `GET /api/v1/tool-settings` show effective sandbox, web-search,
and guardrail configuration. Common startup settings are:

- `sandbox_url`
- `web_search_url`
- `web_search_provider` and `web_search_provider_api_key`
- `guardrails_url`
- `mcp_allow_loopback` and `mcp_allow_private_hosts`
- `web_search_allow_private_hosts`
- `provider_allow_private_hosts`

See [Built-in tools](tools.md), [MCP](mcp.md), and
[Guardrails](guardrails.md) for behavior and security boundaries.

## Documentation links

By default the dashboard's Documentation link opens the bundled guide at
`/#/docs`. Set `docs_url` or `OTARI_DOCS_URL` to point it at an absolute
HTTP or HTTPS URL. The bundled guide remains available.

## Legal pages

The account menu carries a Terms of service row and a Data & Privacy row for
whichever of them this deployment has published. Set `terms_url` or
`OTARI_TERMS_URL`, and `privacy_url` or `OTARI_PRIVACY_URL`, to absolute HTTP or
HTTPS URLs:

```yaml
terms_url: "https://example.com/terms"
privacy_url: "https://example.com/privacy"
```

Each is independent. Unset, the Terms of service row is absent and the Data &
Privacy row stays disabled. A deployment whose dashboard sits beside a site that
owns the documents points at that site. `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` publishes both
addresses unauthenticated, so a credential in either is refused at startup, the
way `data_plane_url` refuses one. The same check covers `docs_url`.

## The interface address

The gateway hands a browser absolute URLs in two places: the redirect that
finishes an OAuth sign-in, and the links in verification, password-reset and
invitation mail. Both point at `public_base_url`, which is right wherever this
process serves its own dashboard.

Where an edge serves the dashboard from another origin or path prefix, set
`ui_base_url` or `OTARI_UI_BASE_URL` to where a browser reaches it:

```yaml
public_base_url: "https://api.example.com"
ui_base_url: "https://app.example.com/dashboard"
```

Unset, `public_base_url` answers for it. Supply an absolute http(s) URL with no
trailing slash; a relative one would survive the redirect and mean nothing in an
inbox. Credentials, query strings and fragments are refused: this value travels
in a redirect and into outgoing mail.

Left unset on a split deployment, an OAuth callback lands the browser on an
origin holding none of the sign-in state it started with, and the sign-in fails
with the authorization code unspent. Passkeys need their own settings there; see
[Access control](access-control.md#passkeys).

## The data-plane address

A hosted control plane does not serve inference. Set `data_plane_url` or
`OTARI_DATA_PLANE_URL` to the gateway origin used by client snippets:

```yaml
data_plane_url: "https://gateway.example.com"
```

Supply the origin or path prefix without a trailing slash or `/api/v1`. Credentials,
query strings, and fragments are refused because `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` publishes
this value without authentication.

## otari.ai variables

Hybrid mode requires `OTARI_AI_TOKEN`. Optional platform settings control the
platform API URL, management URL, health-probe path, resolution timeout,
usage-report timeout and retries, and first-chunk fallback timeout. See
[Modes](modes.md) and the normative
[hybrid-mode protocol](hybrid-mode-protocol.md).

## Extending Otari with a bootstrap module

`bootstrap` or `OTARI_BOOTSTRAP` names a trusted `module:callable` loaded
inside the gateway process. The callable can rebind extension ports and
contribute capability-gated routers. Most deployments should leave it unset.

This is executable code, not a feature flag. Install the module in the gateway
environment, pin it to a compatible Otari release, and authenticate every
contributed route. See [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the extension
boundary.
