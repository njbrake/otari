# Models

Otari routes provider calls through
[any-llm](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm). Provider support changes with
that dependency, so the running gateway's `GET /api/v1/models` response is more
reliable than a copied provider table.

## Model format

Use `provider:model`:

```text
openai:gpt-5
anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
ollama:llama3
```

The prefix selects a provider or named provider instance. Everything after the
first colon is sent as the provider's model ID. A standalone response's `model`
is the selector that was sent (`openai:gpt-5`), not the provider's own name for
the model that served it. When that name differs (a dated snapshot, say), a
non-streaming response carries it in the `X-Otari-Served-Model` header.

`provider/model` is also accepted on completion routes for compatibility with
otari.ai. Prefer the colon form in standalone configuration, pricing, aliases,
and routing policies.

## Configuring a provider

A provider can come from `config.yml`, its native credential environment
variable, or the standalone Providers page:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

A native variable such as `OPENAI_API_KEY` can be enough to dispatch a direct
request. Add the provider to `providers` when you also want model discovery or
explicit client settings.

Provider support is endpoint-specific. A provider that supports chat may not
support Responses, images, audio, rerank, or batches. Unsupported combinations
are rejected before dispatch when Otari can identify them.

## Named provider instances

Use a named instance when several backends share one provider implementation or
when a self-hosted server speaks a compatible protocol:

```yaml
providers:
  home_lab:
    provider_type: openai
    api_base: "https://models.example.com/v1"
    api_key: ${HOME_LAB_TOKEN}
    models:
      - qwen3-32b
```

Call this model as `home_lab:qwen3-32b`. Pricing and usage also use the instance
name. `provider_type: openai-compatible` and `openai_compatible` are accepted
aliases for the OpenAI implementation.

The optional `models` list supplies discovery for a backend that has no
model-listing endpoint. It does not restrict direct dispatch.

Named instances are local configuration and do not apply in hybrid mode, where
the control plane resolves each attempt.

## Local providers

Ollama, llama.cpp, and llamafile can run without an API key. Add a provider entry
when you want Otari to discover their models:

```yaml
providers:
  ollama:
    api_base: "http://gpu-box:11434"
```

Without the entry, a direct selector can still work if the backend is reachable
at the provider's default address. Otari does not probe local servers merely
because their provider exists in any-llm.

## Model discovery

`GET /api/v1/models` combines discoverable provider models, configured prices,
aliases, and routing-policy names. Discovery is cached and bounded; an
unreachable provider does not block the catalog indefinitely.

Set `model_discovery: false` to publish a curated catalog made from aliases and
explicitly priced models. For a backend with no listing API, use the instance's
`models` list.

Hosted mode keeps `GET /api/v1/models` for control-plane discovery. Hybrid mode
does not serve the local catalog.

### Who is shown which models

An API key is shown the models its allow-list permits, so the catalog never
advertises a model that would be refused at inference. A dashboard session is
answered the same way, from its membership: a caller who operates the deployment
sees the whole catalog, and anyone else sees every `providers:` instance, which
is deployment-wide, plus the models their own organization's provider keys
reach, narrowed by any workspace model restriction. A deployment whose providers
all come from `config.yml` therefore shows every tenant the same catalog it
always did.

Aliases and stored routing policies are workspace-scoped rows, and the catalog
reads them for a workspace rather than filtering them by target, so a name alone
would cross a tenant boundary that the allow-list cannot see. A session is
therefore shown that layer only where the workspace it comes from is one the
caller may see, which on a single-tenant deployment is everyone in it. An API key
is unaffected: it names its own workspace.

## Capabilities

`model_capabilities` can correct image and PDF support when a compatible
provider reports capability at the protocol level rather than for each model:

```yaml
model_capabilities:
  "ollama:qwen2-vl":
    supports_image: true
    supports_pdf: false
```

File handling uses these values to decide whether to pass an attachment through
or normalize it for a text-only model. See [Files](files.md).

## Model aliases

An alias gives callers a stable name for one real selector:

```yaml
aliases:
  fast: openai:gpt-5-mini
  local: home_lab:qwen3-32b
```

Callers send the alias in `model`. Completion responses keep the alias while
pricing, budgets, and usage use the resolved target. Configure the target's
price, not a price under the alias.

An alias also withholds its target from model listings in that workspace. This
does not apply to routing-policy targets.

Aliases are useful for a curated catalog. A routing policy is the broader form
when a name needs conditions, failover, weighting, learned selection, or
mandatory guardrails. See [Routing](routing.md).

Alias names cannot contain `:` or `/`, collide with provider instances, or
point to another alias.

### Runtime aliases

Standalone operators can manage aliases from Routing or `/api/v1/aliases` without
restarting. A stored alias belongs to a workspace and can optionally be narrowed
to one user. Resolution prefers the most specific applicable alias.

The authenticating API key determines the workspace. A user-scoped alias applies
to all of that user's keys in the workspace. Config-file aliases are
deployment-wide and apply in every workspace.

Use the generated OpenAPI specification for management request shapes and
scoping parameters.

## Routing-policy model names

A static one-target policy resolves anywhere an alias does. A conditional,
weighted, or learned policy applies only to Chat Completions, Messages, and
Responses because other endpoints do not provide the request context needed to
choose a candidate.

Policies appear as model names, but dynamic policies have no single price.
Price their concrete candidates. Unlike aliases, policies do not hide candidate
models from the catalog.

## The catalog, grouped by model

`GET /api/v1/catalog/models` reads the same merged catalog as `GET /api/v1/models` and
folds it by model, so `nebius:zai-org/GLM-5.3` and
`fireworks:accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p3` are two offerings of one entry.
`?at_context=<tokens>` on the list takes each model's minimum from the pricing
tier a request of that size would settle at, so tiered offerings compare at
the size that matters rather than at their base rate.
`GET /api/v1/catalog/models/{id}` lists every offering of one model the caller may
use, cheapest first, with each provider's context and output limits and the
price the caller's organization would be charged, labeled by which price list
it came from: the organization's own override, the deployment's stored rate, or
the genai-prices default. Both routes accept the same credentials as
`GET /api/v1/models`, and a model the caller may not use answers 404.

Grouping keys on the models.dev display name where the dataset knows the
model, and on the provider's id with its path prefixes, org segment and version
pins removed where it does not. A model's id is its vendor and its name,
`z-ai/glm-5.3`, or the bare name where nobody could say the vendor. A dated build, a size or tier, and a mode a
reseller exposes as its own id stay separate models. models.dev's description,
capabilities and modalities are served to every catalog reader here, where
`GET /api/v1/models/metadata` stays operator-only.

Each offering also carries the provider's own list price from models.dev,
where it has one, and for a signed-in caller the organization's last thirty
days on that offering: requests, cache hit rate, and the effective price per
million tokens after cache reads and tiers.

### Short selectors

A provider's own id can be long, so the gateway also accepts two spellings the
catalog shows. `instance:<cleaned id>` (`fireworks:glm-5.3`, spelled as the
catalog spells the name) resolves to the provider's full id on that instance,
where only one offering on the instance cleans to it. The model's catalog id
(`z-ai/glm-5.3`) resolves to the model's cheapest offering by the deployment's
own rates. Where that id's vendor is also a provider's name (`openai/gpt-4o`,
which is equally the legacy spelling of a request to OpenAI), it resolves only
among that provider's own offerings and otherwise not at all: a selector that
names a provider reaches that provider or fails, and is never redirected to
another one. A model's `selector` in the catalog is null where it has no such
spelling. Both are relabeled
like an alias, so a response's `model` is what was sent, and pricing, budgets
and usage key on the offering reached. A key whose allow-list names some
instances only should send one of those instances or an alias, since a bare
model id resolves before the allow-list is consulted. The index behind this is
rebuilt every minute from the deployment's catalog view and on
`POST /api/v1/catalog/selectors/refresh`, an operator call, and each offering's
`short_selector` and each model's `selector` in the catalog say what is in
force.

The dashboard's Models page is this catalog: one card per model, with a rail
of filters beside it, and a page per model with its facts and every offering
compared in a table. "Use this model" opens a drawer beside the table with
the request to copy, sent to the gateway's pick or to a provider pinned by
its selector. It is read-only; a deployment rate is set on Model pricing, which the
offering rows link to for an operator, and an organization admin is linked to
its own rate override instead. A metered rate that differs from the provider's
list price is marked with the list price.

With `public_catalog: true` (see [Configuration](configuration.md)), the same
two routes and the same page are served to a visitor with no session, at the
deployment's rates and for the configured providers only.

## Listing available models

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OTARI_API_KEY"
```

## HuggingFace provider routing

A HuggingFace model may be served by several inference providers. Pin the backend
when deterministic routing and pricing matter:

```text
huggingface:zai-org/GLM-4.6:together
huggingface:zai-org/GLM-4.6:novita
```

Otari splits only the first colon, so the backend suffix reaches HuggingFace
unchanged. Auto, cheapest, or fastest routing cannot be assigned one reliable
backend price; configure pinned selectors when enforcing budgets.
