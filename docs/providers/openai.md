# OpenAI

Route requests to OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, the o-series, and others) through Otari. See any-llm's [supported providers](https://docs.mozilla.ai/any-llm/providers/) for the current provider list and [Models](../models.md) for Otari's model-name format.

## What you'll set up

An OpenAI provider entry in your `config.yml` (or a single environment variable), then a first request that Otari routes to OpenAI.

## Prerequisites

- Otari running locally (see the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md))
- An OpenAI account and an API key from <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>

## Configure

Add OpenAI under `providers:` in your `config.yml`:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: "sk-..."                        # your OpenAI API key
    # api_base: "https://api.openai.com/v1"  # optional; override for a proxy or compatible endpoint
```

To keep your provider key out of the file with environment interpolation:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
```

...then export it before starting Otari:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

> Otari routes through [any-llm](https://pypi.org/project/any-llm-sdk/), so a standard `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment is picked up automatically even if you don't list the provider explicitly.

### Optional settings

`client_args` are passed through to the underlying `any-llm` provider client, for options such as custom headers or timeouts:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    client_args:
      timeout: 60
      custom_headers:
        OpenAI-Organization: "org-..."
```

## Choose a model

Models are addressed as `openai:<model>`:

```text
openai:gpt-4o
openai:gpt-4o-mini
openai:o4-mini
```

Everything after the colon is passed straight to OpenAI, so any model your key can access works.

## Verify

If you have not already started Otari and created a client key, follow the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) through step 3 first.

Then make a request with the Otari Python SDK (`pip install otari`; any
OpenAI-compatible client also works), using an `openai:<model>` selector:

```python
from otari import OtariClient

client = OtariClient(api_base="http://localhost:8000", api_key="gw-...")
resp = client.completion(
    model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say hello in five words."}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

Expected (sample) output:

```text
Hello, nice to meet you!
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| HTTP 502 `The provider rejected the gateway's credentials` | The `api_key` Otari sent to OpenAI is invalid or lacks access. Check the `api_key` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`) configured on the gateway. |
| HTTP 404 (OpenAI's own "model not found" text) | The name after `openai:` is not a model your key can access, or the model name is misspelled. A rejection of your request carries OpenAI's own message, so the detail says which model it could not find. `The requested model was not found on the provider` appears instead when OpenAI sent no message at all. |
| HTTP 502 `The upstream provider account is out of credit or over its billing limit.` | The provider rejected the call because the account Otari billed has no credit left or has hit its billing limit (for example OpenAI's "billing hard limit reached", or Anthropic's "credit balance is too low", which arrives as a 400). Top up the provider account, or point the model at a provider that has credit. The usage log keeps the status the provider actually returned, so these stay countable. |
| HTTP 502 `LLM provider error` | Generic fallback: Otari reached the provider but the upstream call failed in a way it could not classify (for example a missing provider key, a provider-side 5xx, or a connection error). |
| HTTP 402 `No pricing configured for model ...` | Otari could not resolve pricing for that model and `require_pricing` rejected the request. Add a `pricing:` entry, enable `default_pricing: true` for bundled fallback pricing, or use a model that already has pricing coverage. |
| HTTP 401 `Invalid master key` on `/api/v1/keys` | You passed a client (`gw-...`) key, or the wrong master key, instead of the configured master key. |

## Pricing (optional)

To track cost for a model, add a `pricing:` entry in `config.yml`:

```yaml
pricing:
  openai:gpt-4o-mini:
    input_price_per_million: 0.15
    output_price_per_million: 0.60
```

See [Configuration](../configuration.md) for all options.
