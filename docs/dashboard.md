# Admin dashboard

Otari serves its dashboard at the gateway root. The dashboard uses the same
management API available to scripts, so access and behavior are determined by the
server rather than duplicated in the frontend.

## Deployment modes

- **Standalone** shows the local management UI and serves inference from the same
  process.
- **Hosted** shows the multi-tenant control plane. Inference snippets point to
  `data_plane_url`; the hosted process does not serve inference.
- **Hybrid** shows gateway health and a link to the otari.ai control plane. It has
  no local management UI.

The dashboard reads `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` before rendering. That response controls
the available sign-in methods and navigation surfaces, so a page that is not
available in the current mode is not offered.

## Sign-in and secrets

The master key and `OTARI_SECRET_KEY` are different credentials:

| Credential | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Master key | Authorizes deployment management and signs in the first operator |
| `OTARI_SECRET_KEY` | Encrypts provider and search-tool credentials stored in the database |

If `OTARI_MASTER_KEY` is unset on a new standalone database, Otari generates a
master key and prints it once. The dashboard exchanges it for an HttpOnly session
cookie; it does not store the master key in browser storage.

Set `OTARI_SECRET_KEY` before saving provider or search-tool credentials through
the dashboard:

```bash
otari gen-secret-key
```

Keep this key separate from the database. Losing it makes stored credentials
undecryptable. Providers configured in `config.yml` do not require it.

The operator can claim a new deployment by setting an email address and password
from Account settings. After that, the sign-in page uses the password rather than
the master key. The master key remains valid for management API calls and can
reset the operator password.

The sign-in page offers the email and password form as soon as any identity holds
a password, which can be before the operator claims the deployment: a member
added to the roster and signed up signs in there. While both credentials still
work, the page offers the master-key box beside the form.

Account settings also carries the name you are known by, which is not a
credential: it is what the account menu, the organization roster and the user
column on Usage and Activity show. Someone an admin added to the roster by
address has no name until they set one here. Clearing it puts those surfaces
back to naming you by your sign-in address.

## First-run walkthrough

1. Start Otari in standalone mode.
2. Open the gateway root, usually `http://localhost:8000/`.
3. Sign in with the configured or generated master key.
4. Add a provider. If storing its credential in the dashboard, configure
   `OTARI_SECRET_KEY` first.
5. Test the provider connection or declare model IDs for a backend that has no
   model-listing endpoint.
6. Create an API key from the setup guide or the Keys page.
7. Send a request and confirm it appears under Activity.

The [Quickstart](quickstart.md) includes a complete request example.

## The setup guide

Overview offers a short setup flow until the selected workspace serves its first
successful gateway request from outside the product. A message sent in the
Playground does not close it: the guide marks the moment somebody's own code
first reached the gateway, which is the point of the flow. The key it creates is
an ordinary workspace API key.
Skipping the guide hides it for that workspace; it does not revoke a key already
created. Set `activation_guide: false` to disable the flow for the deployment.

## Navigation

The workspace view contains day-to-day gateway operations:

- Overview, Activity, and Usage
- Playground, Models, and Routing. Models is the catalog grouped by model: a
  list of cards with a rail of filters beside it, and a page per model where
  every offering of it is compared, one per provider, each with its own limits
  and the price your organization is charged. It is read-only; a rate is set on
  Model pricing.
- Tools
- API keys, providers, and workspace members

The organization view contains tenant-wide administration:

- Organization-wide usage, in hosted mode
- Workspaces and organization members
- Email domains, for joining colleagues automatically
- Spend and budgets
- Organization pricing
- Organization settings and, in hosted mode, provider keys

Settings shows the effective non-secret configuration. Some values can be changed
at runtime and others require a restart. The server marks that distinction in the
settings response.

What a page shows can also depend on who is signed in, not only on the
deployment. Spend and budgets is the clearest case: an organization owner or
admin manages their own organization's budgets and the spend ceilings holding
them, while a deployment operator gets the deployment-wide budgets and the
gateway users assigned to them. Model pricing splits the same way, with the
default pricing catalog kept to an operator and the organization's own rate
overrides open to its admins. An override covers a model the organization
supplies the provider key for; a model reached through one of the deployment's
own provider instances is priced by the catalog, because the deployment holds
that credential and settles its upstream bill. For an operator that section
also shows the update a scheduled genai-prices check has left for review, when
the defaults were last accepted and by whom, and how far each stored rate sits
from today's default.

Exact page names and availability can change with deployment mode and installed
extensions. The running dashboard is the source of truth.

What a page shows can also depend on who is signed in. On API keys, an operator
manages every key in the organization and chooses each key's owner, while a
member sees the same page scoped to their own keys, always billed to themselves
and never budget-exempt.

Overview splits the same way. Everyone lands on their own spend, traffic and
recent requests. An organization owner or admin also gets a budget-health
figure, read from the spend ceilings holding their organization, while a
deployment operator gets provider health and the deployment's own budgets
instead.

## Playground

The Playground is the in-product chat page: pick a model the gateway serves and
talk to it, or put two side by side and record which answered better. Requests
run through the same path as any other completion, so routing policies,
guardrails, budgets and the tool loop all apply, and every request appears in
Activity and Usage.

Two things are worth knowing about how it is billed and what it stores.

A Playground request carries no API key. It is authorized by the dashboard
session and billed to whoever sent it, in the workspace the switcher has
selected, against that person's own budget and rate limit; its usage row
therefore has no key attached. Picking a different model changes which provider
credential the gateway resolves, never who pays. A request made here also does
not count as the workspace's first request, so the setup guide keeps waiting for
one from outside the product, which is the milestone it exists to mark.

Nothing is stored until asked for. Saving a conversation or recording a
comparison prompts once for content retention, and the flags are per person and
revocable; withdrawing one blocks new saves and deletes nothing. Saved
transcripts, recorded comparisons and pinned models are visible only to the
person who created them, even to colleagues in the same workspace, and each can
be deleted from the page. Hosted control planes serve no inference, so they do
not offer the page at all.

## Observability

Activity is the per-request log. Usage provides aggregates and time series.
Routed requests share a request-group ID, so Activity can show the attempted
models and the model that served the response. Imported usage is labeled by
source and does not consume a budget.

Use Prometheus at `/metrics` for process-level monitoring when
`enable_metrics` is enabled.

## Organization

Organizations own workspaces. The workspace switcher determines which keys,
members, usage, tools, aliases, and stored routing policies are in view. The
organization section manages resources shared across those workspaces.

What a signed-in person can see or change is enforced by their organization and
workspace roles. Deployment-wide operations require an operator. See
[Access control](access-control.md).

## Authentication options

Password sign-in is tied to an existing identity, unless the deployment sets
`open_signup: true`, which lets an unknown address register itself with an
organization of its own. Optional passkeys, Google OAuth, and GitHub OAuth add
ways for an existing identity to sign in; they do not make an unknown account a
member. OAuth requires `public_base_url` plus the
provider's client ID and secret. Passkeys can instead use `public_base_url`, or
an explicit `webauthn_rp_id` and `webauthn_allowed_origins` pair.

Signing in *can* add a membership in one case. If an organization has claimed and
proven the email domain that the identity's verified address belongs to, the
sign-in joins them to that organization at the role the claim names, whichever of
the three credentials they used. It is the only path that grants membership
without somebody deciding about the person, and it is fenced accordingly: see
[Email-domain auto-join](access-control.md#email-domain-auto-join).

Mail is optional. Without SMTP, invitation links can still be copied and shared
manually. See [Configuration](configuration.md#mail). Setting a password is the
step that needs mail, because it sends a verification link, so on a deployment
without mail an operator generates one instead: **Accounts**, then **Set
password**, shows it once to hand over.

## Bundled guide and custom documentation

This guide is bundled into the dashboard at `/#/docs`. Set `docs_url` to make
the dashboard's Documentation link open a different site. The bundled route
remains available.

## Legal pages

`terms_url` and `privacy_url` name where this deployment's terms of service and
privacy notice live. The account menu links each row it has an address for; see
[Configuration](configuration.md#legal-pages).

## Development

The dashboard source is under `web/`. The published Docker image includes the
bundle. A source checkout needs `make dashboard` for the gateway to serve it, or
`pnpm --dir web dev` for frontend development. See [web/README.md](../web/README.md).
