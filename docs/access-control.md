# Access control

Otari separates deployment administration, human identity, workload credentials,
and spend limits. This page explains how those pieces relate. The generated
[OpenAPI specification](public/openapi.json) is the source of truth for endpoint
schemas.

## Deployment-wide account administration

The master key controls the deployment. A dashboard session can perform
deployment-wide operations only when its identity has operator authority.
Organization roles do not implicitly grant access to process-wide settings or
credentials.

Use the master key through `Authorization: Bearer <master-key>` or
`Otari-Key: <master-key>`. Applications should use scoped API keys instead.

## Organizations and workspaces

An organization is the tenant boundary. It owns workspaces, members, provider
keys, pricing overrides, guardrail policy, and organization-wide usage views.

A workspace groups the resources used by a team or application. API keys, usage,
aliases, routing policies, MCP servers, and tool policy are resolved in a
workspace.

Organization and workspace memberships use four roles:

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Full management, including organization administration |
| Admin | Manage most organization or workspace resources |
| Member | Use the workspace and read permitted resources |
| Viewer | Read-only access |

The API key that authenticates a request determines its workspace. A caller
cannot select another workspace with a header. Master-key inference uses the
default workspace.

## Users and identities

Otari maintains identities for dashboard sign-in and user records for request
attribution and per-user budgets. Management flows connect them where needed.
Client-provided `user` values are never trusted to move spend away from the API
key's bound user.

A user's `allowed_models` is inherited by newly created keys unless the key
defines its own list. A missing list allows any model, an empty list allows none,
and entries may use provider wildcards such as `openai:*`.

Deleting or deactivating a user prevents future access but preserves historical
usage.

## API keys

API keys are workload credentials. Each key has a fixed user and workspace and
may also define:

- expiration and active status
- allowed models
- budget exemption
- whether mismatched client `user` fields are accepted
- whether content-free agent telemetry is captured
- application metadata

The plaintext key is returned only when it is created or rotated. Store it then.
Rotation preserves the key record and invalidates the previous secret.

A budget-exempt key is also exempt from `require_pricing`. Reserve such keys for
usage import or other intentional observability-only traffic.

`/api/v1/keys` manages every key in the caller's organization and requires the
deployment operator's standing. A signed-in member without it manages their own
keys at `/api/v1/organizations/me/keys`, which derives the owner rather than
accepting one, mints only into a workspace the caller may see, and never issues
a budget-exempt key.

## Budgets

Otari enforces budgets before dispatch and reconciles actual cost afterwards.
Requests must pass every applicable limit.

Two budget forms exist:

- A per-user budget limits each attached user independently.
- A scoped budget limits an organization, workspace, membership, or API key and
  can optionally narrow the limit to one provider.

A budget caps up to three things over its period, each set independently and
each unlimited when left unset: spend in USD (`max_budget`), total tokens
(`token_limit`), and requests (`request_limit`). A request must have room on
every axis the budget caps. Spend and tokens are held at an upper bound before
dispatch and reconciled to the measured figures afterwards; only the unused part
of an over-estimate is released, and what the request measurably used stays
charged. A request counts as one request when it is admitted. A model priced at
zero spends no dollars, and still spends tokens and one request.
Endpoints that hold no token estimate (embeddings, rerank, and the other
pass-through routes) are refused once a token cap is exhausted rather than
reserving headroom for themselves, so a token cap can be passed by the requests
already in flight when it runs out.

Scoped budgets can use a rolling duration or a UTC calendar boundary. A key with
`exclude_from_budget`, or a deployment with `budget_strategy: disabled`,
bypasses enforcement.

Imported usage is retrospective and never counts toward a budget. Batch cost is
also settled after submission, so operators should not treat those paths as a
hard real-time cap. Batch settles dollars alone: its results arrive outside the
reservation that gated the submission, so a batch counts as the one request that
created it and contributes no tokens to a token cap, however many prompts it
carried. The same holds for the vision side-call a request makes to describe an
attachment. Cap batch-heavy workloads in dollars rather than in tokens. See
[Importing external usage](external-usage.md).

## Workspace-scoped spend

Usage is attributed to the workspace bound to the authenticating API key.
Organization and workspace usage views then apply the signed-in identity's
membership: an owner or admin sees every request in their scope, and a member or
viewer sees only the requests billed to them, even in a workspace they share.
Deployment operators can read the deployment-wide usage API.

Routing fallback and built-in tools can create several internal attempts, but a
successful request remains one caller-visible request. The activity log records
the attempt group and the model that served it.

## Dashboard sessions and identity

The first operator signs in with the master key. Otari exchanges it for an
opaque, HttpOnly session cookie. After the operator sets an email and password,
the dashboard uses that identity for sign-in; the master key remains an API
credential and recovery path.

Email and password sign-in is offered whenever any active identity holds a
password, not only once the operator has claimed the deployment. A member added
to the roster and signed up before that point signs in on the same screen, which
offers the master-key box beside the form while both credentials still work.

Sessions are revocable and expire after `dashboard_session_ttl_hours`. Password
changes, master-key rotation, sign-out, and identity deactivation revoke relevant
sessions.

A session authorizes the management API. It does not authorize
`/api/v1/chat/completions` or any other data-plane path, which take an API key
or the master key and nothing else: a keyless request resolves to the
deployment's default workspace, so honoring a cookie there would let any member
of any organization spend that workspace's provider credential.

The Playground is the one surface that runs a completion from a session, and it
is a separate endpoint rather than a relaxation of that rule.
`POST /api/v1/playground/chat/completions` resolves the caller's own attribution
user and proves their membership of the workspace it will bill before the
request reaches the pipeline, so the request is billed to the person who sent it
in a workspace that is theirs. No credential is minted for the browser and none
is held there. The usage row it writes carries no `api_key_id` and its own
endpoint label, which is what keeps in-product traffic separable from a
customer's integration.

### Passkeys

Passkeys are optional and additive to password sign-in. Set
`public_base_url` to establish the origin and relying-party ID. Use
`webauthn_rp_id` only when passkeys must be bound to a parent domain.

Where an edge serves the dashboard on a different host to the gateway, set
`webauthn_rp_id` to a domain that is a parent of both and list the dashboard
origin in `webauthn_allowed_origins`. The ID is not derived from `ui_base_url`,
so without this the ceremony fails in the browser and nothing is logged here
([#1134](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/issues/1134)).

Changing the relying-party ID makes existing passkeys unusable. The dashboard
continues listing unusable credentials so the owner can remove them.

### OAuth sign-in (Google and GitHub)

OAuth sign-in requires `public_base_url` and the provider's client ID and
secret. Register this redirect URI with the provider:

```text
{public_base_url}/auth/{provider}/callback
```

The gateway answers that path itself and redirects the browser into the
dashboard to finish. Where an edge serves the dashboard elsewhere, set
`ui_base_url` too; see [Configuration](configuration.md#the-interface-address).

OAuth signs in an existing Otari identity whose email the provider verifies. It
does not provision arbitrary provider accounts.

### Signup

Signup sets a password for an address and sends a verification link. What an
unknown address does depends on `open_signup`:

- `false` (default): signup only completes an identity an owner or admin already
  added or invited by address. An address nobody has added gets no account. This
  is the posture a single-tenant deployment wants, since anyone who can reach the
  dashboard can reach the form.
- `true`: an unknown address is registered, with an organization and workspace of
  its own. Use it where the deployment serves many tenants.

Either way the response says the same thing whether the address was unknown,
already claimed, or genuinely just claimed, so its body discloses nothing about
the address. Response *timing* still does, because the eligible path sends mail
before it answers; that is [otari#720](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/issues/720)
and it applies to both postures.

Signup needs mail configured, because an account that cannot verify its address
cannot sign in.

Open signup puts tenant creation on an unauthenticated route. The per-IP
throttle on the public auth routes is the only bound on it today, and nothing
expires the organization an unverified signup leaves behind, so run it behind
whatever edge controls the deployment has.

## Invitations

An owner or admin can invite a person to an organization and selected workspaces.
If mail is configured, Otari sends the accept link. Otherwise the API and
dashboard expose the link for manual delivery.

Invitation tokens are bearer credentials. Do not put them in logs or analytics.
The browser validates and accepts them through the public invitation endpoints.

A signed-in person also sees the invitations addressed to them, and accepts or
declines one without a token: they are already authenticated as the addressee,
so the membership is addressed by id instead. Declining cancels the invitation
and suspends the paired membership, which is what stops the emailed link from
reviving it; a later invitation to the same address revives the membership.

## Email-domain auto-join

An owner or admin can claim an email domain so that colleagues join the
organization without being invited one at a time. It is the second way somebody
becomes a member, and unlike an invitation nobody decides about the individual,
so it is fenced accordingly.

A claim grants nothing on its own. Otari mints a verification token, the admin
publishes it as a TXT record at the claimed domain's apex, and only a claim whose
record Otari has found admits anyone:

```text
otari-domain-verification=<token>
```

Claiming is not exclusive; proving is. Several organizations may hold an unproven
claim on one domain and the first to publish the record takes it, which is what
stops a claim on a domain somebody else owns from locking out its real owner.

Once a domain is proven, anyone signing in with a **verified** address at that
domain joins as the role the claim names. The rules around that are deliberately
narrow:

- Only `member` and `viewer` can be handed out. Proving control of a domain is
  not a decision about a person, so it never confers organization management.
- An unverified address is skipped, so signing up on an address without reading
  the mail is not enough.
- An existing membership is left alone. A suspended one is not revived by
  signing in, and an established role is not overwritten.
- The person's active organization is never changed by joining.
- Public email providers cannot be claimed.

A proof expires. Domains change hands, so a claim stops admitting anyone once its
proof passes the deployment's TTL, and an admin renews it by verifying again from
the Email domains page. Nothing re-reads DNS between verifications, so that TTL is
the window in which a transferred domain still admits people.
