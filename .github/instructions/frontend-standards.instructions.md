# Frontend Standards (dashboard)

These auto-apply when reviewing or editing the `web/` admin dashboard (React 19 with the React
Compiler, TypeScript strict, HeroUI v3, Tailwind v4, TanStack Query, Vitest, Playwright). The
full guidance, with worked examples grounded in this dashboard's code, lives in the skill:
[.github/skills/frontend-standards/SKILL.md](../skills/frontend-standards/SKILL.md).

## Non-negotiables

1. **HeroUI v3 only.** Unified `@heroui/react` import, compound components (`Card.Content`,
   `Card.Header`), `onChange` (not `onValueChange`), `onPress` (not `onClick`), and a `variant`
   (not `color`) on `Button`. No v2 patterns: granular `@heroui/*` imports, `HeroUIProvider`,
   `classNames={{ slot }}` objects, `bg-content1`. An internal link is TanStack Router's
   `<Link to>`; HeroUI's `<Link href>` is a full page reload.
   See [components.md](../skills/frontend-standards/components.md).

2. **Variables and props over hand-written CSS.** Start from a HeroUI component or a shared
   primitive rather than a native element, which arrives with the tokens and its states
   (pointer, focus ring, disabled dimming) already wired. A native element is sometimes the
   right call anyway (a nav row has to be the router's `Link`), and then those states become
   classes the call site names itself, so `cursor-pointer` on a bare `<button>` is correct
   rather than a finding. Then four ways to change how it looks, in order: a variable (ours
   as a token, or one of HeroUI's own aliased onto ours;
   `--radius` drives its whole radius ramp, and it, `--disabled-opacity` and
   `--field-border-width` are the three HeroUI variables `globals.css` already declares.
   `--cursor-interactive`, `--ring-offset-width`, the `--scrollbar-*` family and the rest
   are still only in `@heroui/styles/dist/themes/`, and an alias for one of those goes into
   `globals.css` rather than into a class string of ours. Our variable block is unlayered
   and has to stay that way: `@heroui/styles` declares many of the same names from inside
   `@layer`, and an unlayered declaration is what outranks a layered one), a shared utility
   once the look repeats, the component's own prop (`variant`, `size`, `isDisabled`,
   `isPending`, `fullWidth`, `isInvalid`), and only then a rule against HeroUI's
   own classes under the `.otari-*` namespace. Those names are BEM and the shape is not
   optional: a block is `otari-<block>`, an element `otari-<block>__<element>`, a modifier
   `otari-<block>--<modifier>`. A stylesheet is global whatever imports it, so the prefix and
   the two separators are the collision story, and `src/architecture.test.ts` parses that
   shape, which makes a name departing from it invisible to the probe rather than merely
   inconsistent. Which file it goes in is a finding too: a rule whose subject is a
   `design-system/` primitive's own DOM belongs in `web/src/design-system/design-system.css`,
   which `globals.css` imports first, while a per-table block and anything whose consumers
   are feature pages stays in `globals.css`.
   HeroUI and Tailwind both permit that last one and
   it stays discouraged here, so the finding is not that it is forbidden but that a rung above
   reaches the value: a rule like `.otari-table .table__cell` or
   `.table__body tr:first-child td:first-child` is a finding unless nothing above it can do the
   job, because it fixes one selector instead of every rule reading the value, and because these
   rules are unlayered and so outrank a Tailwind class at the call site. A
   `className` re-skinning something the component already styles is a finding too; reserve
   `className` for layout/position. Space siblings with
   `gap-*` on the parent, not `m-*` on children, and write arbitrary values in `rem`
   (`h-[20rem]`, not `h-[320px]`; a `1px` border is the exception). A shared component never
   bakes an outside margin into its own root: what sits between two things is the parent's
   decision. An inline `style={{}}` is a finding for anything a class can express, and is
   **correct** for a value computed at runtime that no class can (a percentage width, a
   computed offset): Tailwind emits only the utilities the source names, so `w-[${pct}%]`
   compiles to nothing.

3. **Color and type come from the semantic tokens** in `web/src/styles/globals.css`. The
   tokens are the design system; HeroUI and Tailwind consume it, so a utility that does not
   resolve to a `--color-*` token is outside the system and will not follow a retheme. Use the
   utilities the tokens back (`text-muted`, `bg-surface`, `border-border`, `text-danger`,
   `text-heading`), add a token there rather than scattering a hex, and add it to both theme
   blocks *and* to the file's `@theme` block: a token declared and not registered generates no
   utility, so the class at the call site silently resolves to nothing. A raw hex, a numbered Tailwind palette class, and `bg-white` / `text-black` all
   fail `web/src/styles/foundation.test.ts`, over the whole of `web/src`. Two pairings are
   easy to get wrong: a status word wears its own color on its own subtle fill
   (`text-danger` on `bg-danger-subtle`), but brand text on the brand tint takes
   `text-primary-subtle-foreground`, not `text-accent`. The two rule tiers are not
   interchangeable either: `--color-border` divides one section from the next, while
   `--color-border-subtle` divides repeated rows inside one, and a status dot takes the text
   ramp (`bg-text-subtle`) because a surface value on a 6px square measures about 1.1:1 and is
   not a quiet dot but no dot. Type comes from the seven roles, so a
   `text-[11px]` or a `text-2xl font-bold` is a finding. See
   [design-tokens.md](../skills/frontend-standards/design-tokens.md).

4. **Server state goes through TanStack Query + `apiFetch`.** Fetch via the hooks in
   `web/src/shared/api/` (one module per domain); keep query keys in `shared/api/queryKeys.ts`,
   set a deliberate `staleTime`,
   and invalidate only the keys a mutation changes. Guard with `isPending && !data` (never bare
   `isPending`, never `isLoading`) and give a filtered or paginated query
   `placeholderData: (prev) => prev`, or the page blanks on every filter change. Don't call
   `fetch()` directly for authenticated management requests; `apiFetch` uses the HttpOnly
   session cookie and signs out on 401, while public sign-in helpers stay outside that path.
   Anything that must stay live takes `refetchInterval`, never a hand-rolled `setInterval`.
   Never mirror server state into `useState`, and never swallow a mutation error. **The
   dashboard is a thin rendering layer**: it does not filter, search, sort, join or aggregate
   server data, and it does not assemble one view out of several responses and join them by id
   in the browser. If the endpoint the page needs does not exist, creating it is the change to
   make, and the gateway is in this repository. **A list hook asks for the page on
   screen**, taking `skip` and `limit` from the URL state with
   `placeholderData: (prev) => prev`; every gateway list route accepts both and rejects a
   `limit` above 1000 rather than clamping. Reading a whole collection is the finding, and a
   cap on the walk does not answer it: the cap stops the walk looping, it does not paginate the
   read, and everything downstream still sorts and filters in the browser. A hook that looks
   like it needs one needs something from the endpoint instead: a search parameter for a
   picker, an embedded label or a batch lookup where a page is resolving ids. `fetchAllPaged`
   and `fetchAllRows` serve the nineteen reads that predate the rule (#1376); a new caller of
   either is a finding. A fire-and-forget call is prefixed with `void`, which
   marks it as deliberately not awaited and is what lets the floating-promise lint flag the
   ones that were forgotten. It is a marker and not error handling: `void` discards the
   rejection too, so it is correct only where the promise cannot reject meaningfully
   (`invalidateQueries` and `refetch` resolve with state; `useAutosave`'s `run` catches into
   its own error). A `void` on a call that can fail is the finding, and the fix is a `.catch`
   that reports or an `await` in a function that owns the failure. See
   [data-fetching.md](../skills/frontend-standards/data-fetching.md).

5. **TypeScript + React hygiene.** An absent value in your own types and props is the type's
   own empty value first (`""`, `[]`, `{}`), `undefined` only where no empty value can stand in
   without colliding with a real one **and the declaration says why**, and never `null` (the API
   layer mirrors the server JSON, so convert at the boundary). A `null` a refactor merely moves
   is a finding against that refactor. So is a type widened to carry the wire's spelling rather
   than converting it: `X | null | undefined` on your own type is the tell, and it means one
   absent value is now spelled two ways for every reader downstream. Prefer a falsy check or a
   default over an explicit `=== undefined` where one reads the same (`Boolean(x)`, `!x`,
   `array.length`); spell the comparison out only where a falsy value is a real answer, as a
   `0` cap or an empty allow-list is. A `boolean | null` or `boolean | undefined` is a finding
   in itself: a boolean holds two answers, its empty value is `false`, and a nullable one is a
   third state smuggled in as an absent value, so it wants a named union and a conversion at the
   wire. A boolean reads as a question in English (`isPending`,
   `hasBudget`, `canRevokeKey`), and that covers a local, a prop and a boolean field of a hook's
   return alike: a bare verb or noun phrase (`operates`, `ready`) reads as the thing rather than
   as an answer about it. `unknown` plus a guard where a type is genuinely unknown, not `any`; a discriminated
   union rather than a bag of optionals; named exports and named imports, no barrel files;
   correct effect dependency arrays with cleanup; derive from props/query data rather than
   duplicating into state (copying a prop into `useState` and re-syncing it with an effect is
   the finding; adjusting the state during render is the fix, and a `key` only where the draft
   is worth discarding, since keying on the value remounts the control and throws away whatever
   was being typed). Cleanup covers **timers**, and
   covers one started from an event handler or a mutation callback, not only from an effect:
   an uncleared timer touches a gone component and stacks rather than replaces when its
   trigger fires twice inside the window. Names say what a value is, and a single letter says
   less than the generic nouns already banned, so `(entry) => entry.latency_ms` rather than
   `(e) => …`; the exemptions are a comparator's `(a, b)` and a `setState` updater's previous
   value. A function name starts with a verb (`formatCost`, `findFallthroughTarget`,
   `describePartialScopeSave`), because one named for its return value (`cost()`, `weightsOf()`)
   reads like a variable at the call site. A callback prop is named for the event
   (`onConfirm`, `onRevoke`, `onSaved`) and the function behind it for the intent
   (`revokeSelected`, `dismissBanner`), where `handleClick` says only that a click happened. A loop that produces a value is a transformation written the long way, so `for...of`,
   `for...in` and an index loop all read better as `map`/`filter`/`reduce`/`find`/`flatMap`
   (`for...in` additionally walks inherited keys: use `Object.entries`). `forEach` is correct
   where the body is genuinely only a side effect, and takes a block body: Biome's
   `useIterableCallbackReturn` rejects a concise arrow whose body is a call, reading the shape
   rather than the type, so a call returning `void` is flagged too. (`(id) => void fn(id)`
   passes lint and is therefore not a finding, but no code here is written that way.)
   `forEach` is wrong where it is a transformation with the result pushed into an outer
   variable.
   Consuming a stream and a bounded request walk stay imperative. The React Compiler is
   enabled, so the plain expression is the default and reflexive memoization is the finding.
   Hand-written `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo` is correct where it earns its place (an
   expensive computation, a reference something else identity-checks, a component the compiler
   could not optimize because it could not verify the rules of hooks), so do not flag one that
   does: the rule is judgment, not a ban and not a requirement. See
   [typescript-and-react.md](../skills/frontend-standards/typescript-and-react.md) and
   [performance.md](../skills/frontend-standards/performance.md).

6. **New code lands in a layer.** A presentational component with no knowledge of this
   application goes in `web/src/design-system/<topic>/`; a domain's page and the parts only
   it uses go in `web/src/features/<domain>/`; something no domain owns but that does read
   the app goes in `web/src/shared/` (`components/`, `helpers/`, `api/`); test harnesses go
   in `web/src/tests/`; only `web/src/app/` composes the tree. The layout mirrors
   `otari-ai/frontend/src`, so prefer its names for a new directory. A feature may not
   import `app/`, and `shared/` may not import `features/` or `app/`. `pnpm --dir web run lint` (Biome)
   rejects both, so flag placement in review rather than leaving it to the lint to reject
   after the fact. Adding a directory directly under `src/` needs a rule to go with it.

   **`design-system/` may import nothing else under `src/`**, which is the one layer rule
   whose direction is "none" rather than "not upward": it is meant to leave as a package,
   so it gets React, HeroUI, react-aria, react-icons, recharts, react-markdown and its own modules and
   nothing more. In review, an import of `@/shared`, `@/features`, `@/app`, `@/routes` or
   `@/client` from a file under `design-system/` is the finding, and the fix is not a
   different import: the component reads the app, so it is an application component and
   belongs in `shared/components/` composing the primitive. Likewise a primitive that
   fetches, reads `useDeployment()`, or holds state a caller should own.

   Reach for `Button` from `@/design-system/actions/Button` rather than `@heroui/react`.
   The wrapper narrows the variant union to the three that exist, so a retired variant
   (`outline`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, `danger-soft`) is a compile error rather than a
   silently unstyled button. A new primitive owes a `.stories.tsx` beside it covering each
   variant, which is what the published catalog renders.

7. **A page composes; it does not also implement.** A dialog body, a second table, or a pure
   derivation added to a page file belongs in its own file in the same feature. A route file
   under `web/src/routes/` exports `Route` and nothing else, or `autoCodeSplitting` stops
   splitting it and the page lands in the entry chunk every visitor downloads. No IIFEs in
   JSX; no structural markup copy-pasted between files. See
   [component-architecture.md](../skills/frontend-standards/component-architecture.md).

   **A file is named for what it exports**, and nothing enforces that, so it is review's to
   catch: a file with one component subject is `PascalCase.tsx` named for that component, a
   hook is `useCamelCase.ts(x)`, and a helper or pure module is `camelCase.ts`. A file under
   `web/src/routes/` takes whatever file-based routing requires (`tools.guardrails.tsx`) and
   is never renamed by hand. One component sitting in a `camelCase.tsx`, or a `PascalCase.ts`
   holding only helpers, is the finding. A module whose exports share no one subject keeps a
   camelCase name and is not (`design-system/metrics/charts.tsx`,
   `features/providers/providerFields.tsx`), the same carve-out `tabs.test.tsx` has. See
   [naming-conventions.md](../skills/frontend-standards/naming-conventions.md).

8. **Navigation is data, and its three gates stay three.** A *rail* destination is declared in
   `web/src/app/nav/registry.ts` and nowhere else; flag a sidebar link hand-written into a
   component. `/playground`, `/docs`, and `/account` are chrome destinations, so they
   use hand-written `Link`s outside the sidebar sections. Playground and Documentation
   appear in the top bar and in the account menu below `md`; Account settings is that
   menu's first row. Playground remains in route lookup to preserve its surface gate.
   An entry gates on `surface` (the deployment axis, from `GET /v1/bootstrap`
   via `useDeployment`), `capability` (the entitlement axis, via `useEntitlements`), and
   `operatorOnly` (the caller axis, via `useDeploymentAdminAccess`), composed as AND by
   `useNavVisibility`. Do not fold one into another, and do not reach past them: a page
   component that reads the gateway's mode itself, or infers it from an endpoint's 404, is
   the scattered mode check this replaced. A new base capability belongs in
   `BASE_CAPABILITIES`; an overlay's belongs in neither. Hiding a surface client-side is a
   convenience, never an authorization; the server still has to enforce it.
   - The caller axis is the odd one and stays narrow. It is about *who is signed in* where
     the other two are about the deployment, so it is answered by `GET /v1/admin/access`,
     the gate of the one surface it hides, rather than by a rule of its own, and that
     request is itself gated on that surface so a gateway without it is never asked.
     `/admin/accounts` is the only entry that declares it and `registry.test.ts` pins the
     count, so a second one is a design decision rather than a refactor. It also resolves
     asynchronously where the other two do not, so a row naming it is absent until the
     answer is yes.
   - It gates the **rail row only**. `useRouteVisibility` is what `AppShell` gates the
     *route* on, and it composes the two deployment-shaped axes and drops this one: a real
     operator would otherwise read "not available here" for the length of the query, and a
     caller who is genuinely not an operator is looking at a page the deployment does
     serve, which refuses them in its own words. Flag a change that folds the caller axis
     back into the route gate.

9. **Mobile is not optional.** The dashboard installs to a phone home screen and the shell
   already switches to a drawer below `md`. Touch targets ≥44px on the phone viewport, no
   hover-only controls (`opacity-0 group-hover:*` does not exist on a touch device), `min-w-0`
   on flex children that can overflow, no fixed-pixel layout containers, and a table needs a
   card list or its own horizontal scroll below `md`. See
   [responsiveness.md](../skills/frontend-standards/responsiveness.md).

10. **Tests for changed behavior.** Colocated Vitest tests (`Foo.tsx` → `Foo.test.tsx`) that
    query the way a user would (`getByRole`/`getByLabelText`/`getByText`, not `getByTestId`),
    render real providers, and mock only the network boundary, not the hooks. Two forms reach
    that boundary and both are correct: `vi.spyOn(apiClient, "apiFetch")` for an authenticated
    page test, and `vi.mock("@/shared/api/client", importOriginal)` where the subject reaches
    the transport through several exports or before a spy lands, which is the public auth and
    invitation flows. A class selector used to *find* an element is a finding; the one
    exception is pinning a layout property jsdom cannot compute (a reserved height, a collapsed
    edge), asserted with `toHaveClass` on one scoped element, preferring a class that names a
    token, with the reason at the site. That exception covers the assertion and not the query,
    so the element is still reached by role, text or a structural step from either, and an
    absence is the element not being rendered rather than a class going unfound; a
    `container.querySelector(".some-class")` feeding a layout assertion is a finding. Where a
    state has an accessible expression, assert that
    instead: `charts.tsx` switches `role="group"` / `role="img"` on drag selection, so the role
    is the assertion and the cursor utility is not. A node the accessibility tree hides on
    purpose is not covered either: `DataTable`'s detail host is `role="presentation"`, so "a row
    is expanded" is asserted on the detail's own content rather than by counting hosts, and the
    only thing left on the host is that the same node is reused across a re-render. Each
    file restores the globals it overrode and carries no per-assertion timeout override. A new
    page also needs a screenshot entry in `web/e2e/screenshots/`, which is what will cover it
    at three viewports in both themes; that suite runs on demand today rather than as a PR
    gate, so the entry is owed even though nothing fails without it. See [testing.md](../skills/frontend-standards/testing.md).

11. **Rendering work is part of the review.** Animate `transform` and `opacity`; a property
    that changes geometry (`width`, `height`, `top`, `max-height`, `grid-template-rows`) runs
    layout every frame and needs its reason in the rule's comment, as `.otari-detail-reveal`
    has. Every animation answers `prefers-reduced-motion`. `will-change` is applied for the
    duration of an animation and removed after, never left on, because a permanent one is a
    permanent layer. Reading layout (`getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetWidth`, `scrollTop`)
    forces a synchronous flush, so it does not belong in a pointermove handler or an
    unthrottled `resize` listener: measure once where the interaction starts, batch reads
    before writes, prefer a `ResizeObserver`'s `contentRect`, and coalesce through one
    `requestAnimationFrame` (`features/auth/background/LoginBackground.tsx` is the worked
    example). `scroll`, `wheel` and `touchmove` listeners take `{ passive: true }` unless they
    call `preventDefault`. Stacking has no token family yet, so reuse a sibling's `z-` value
    and say what a new layer sits above rather than inventing a higher number. See
    [performance.md](../skills/frontend-standards/performance.md) and
    `web/design/motion-and-access.md`.

    **Nothing flashes and nothing shifts.** A modal is mounted when it opens
    (`{isConfirming && <ConfirmDialog isOpen … />}`) rather than kept in the tree behind a
    prop, so its subtree, listeners and queries do not exist while it is closed. A skeleton is
    the height of what it replaces, or everything below it jumps on swap. Global chrome
    (sidebar, header, breadcrumbs) belongs to `AppShell` and not to a route component, which
    remounts it on every navigation. `window.location.reload()` is not a refresh button:
    invalidate the affected keys instead, and the root error boundary is its one legitimate
    caller. A pre-paint decision, the theme above all, is resolved in `index.html`'s inline
    script as well as in `useTheme`, so a change to the storage key, the three-state
    resolution or the attributes that carry it has to reach both. See
    [layout-stability.md](../skills/frontend-standards/layout-stability.md).

12. **Numbers, money and dates go through `web/src/shared/helpers/format.ts`.** `Intl` does the
    work, never string arithmetic: `"$" + value.toFixed(2)` loses grouping and rounds a
    sub-cent cost to `$0.00`, which for a per-request price is not a rounding error but the
    whole value. Construct a formatter once per module, not once per row of every render.
    Numbers and money are pinned to `en-US` because the dashboard bills in USD, and
    `format.test.ts` sweeps the tree for an unpinned `Intl` formatter and for a bare
    `toLocaleString()`. A calendar date with no instant in it (`YYYY-MM`) is formatted from the
    string rather than through a `Date`, which would shift it a day west of UTC, and timezone
    arithmetic by hand (`d.setHours(d.getHours() - 5)`) breaks across DST. An absent value
    renders as the placeholder these helpers already return, not as an empty cell and not as
    `null`. See
    [formatting-and-i18n.md](../skills/frontend-standards/formatting-and-i18n.md).
