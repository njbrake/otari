# Testing the dashboard

Three suites, each with a different job:

| Suite | Command | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vitest + Testing Library | `pnpm --dir web test` | Components, hooks, pure helpers. The bulk. |
| Playwright behavioral | `pnpm --dir web run e2e` | Multi-page flows against a real gateway. |
| Playwright screenshots | `pnpm --dir web run e2e:screenshots` | How every page renders, at three viewports in both themes. |

Backend testing is a different world (PostgreSQL, Testcontainers, the OSS smoke gate) and
lives in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) under "Test Notes".

## Vitest

`pnpm --dir web test` regenerates the API client first, then runs the suite. Tests are
colocated: `Foo.tsx` → `Foo.test.tsx`, `format.ts` → `format.test.ts`.

**Query the way an operator would.** `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`. Not
`getByTestId`, and never a class selector to *find* an element: `.bg-surface` is a token that
will be renamed, and a test that breaks on a restyle teaches everyone to stop trusting the
suite. Where a state has an accessible expression, assert that: `design-system/metrics/charts.tsx`
switches `role="group"` / `role="img"` on whether the chart owns drag selection, so the role is
the assertion and `.cursor-crosshair` is a hint that follows it.

**The one exception is a layout property jsdom cannot compute.** There is no layout under
jsdom, so "this tile reserves 42px so a missing chip does not collapse the row" is observable
only as the class that causes it, and the screenshot suite that could see it is not a gate yet.
Four rules make that a pin rather than a loophole: assert with `toHaveClass` on one scoped
element (never `className` with `toContain`, see below), prefer a class naming a token over one
naming a number (`min-h-[var(--text-caption-step--line-height)]`, not `min-h-10.5`), say at the
site which layout fact is being pinned, and only for a fact no user-visible query can reach.
`design-system/forms/FieldMessages.test.tsx:119` is the model.

**The exception covers the assertion, not the query.** Reach the element the way any other test
would, by its role, its text, or a structural step from either, and assert the class on what you
found: the description's own parent is the caption line, and a step down from the value reaches
the tile's aside row. `container.querySelector(".text-caption")` is the exception reopening as
the rule it was carved out of, and it fails the "one scoped element" clause anyway, since a
subtree search is not a scope. An absence follows the same shape: "this tile reserves no row"
is the row not being rendered, not a class going unfound.

A node the accessibility tree hides on purpose is not covered by that exception. `DataTable`'s
detail host is `role="presentation"` deliberately (`DataTable.tsx:219`), and its comment says
where to go instead: the content stays in the tree, so "a row is expanded" is asserted on the
detail's own content rather than by counting hosts. What stays on the host is its identity:
`DataTable.test.tsx` pins that the same `<tr>` is reused rather than recreated across a
re-render, which is what stops the panel remounting and has no user-visible form at all. That
is the whole of it, and it says so at the site.

**Mock the network boundary, nothing inside it.** The page tests spy on the transport and let
the real hooks, query keys, formatters, and derivations run:

```tsx
vi.spyOn(apiClient, "apiFetch").mockImplementation(async (input) => {
  const url = String(input)
  if (url.startsWith("/v1/models")) return CATALOG
  …
})
```

Mocking `useModels` or `formatCost` instead hides exactly the regressions worth catching: a
changed query key, a loading state nobody renders, a formatter that rounds wrong. There is no
`vi.mock("@/shared/api/<domain>")` anywhere in this tree, and adding the first one needs a reason
in the diff.

**Two forms reach that boundary, and which one to use follows from the page.** The spy above is
for an authenticated page test, where it is also the assertion surface for the call list. The
module form is for a subject that reaches the transport through more than one export, or before
a spy can be installed, which is the public auth and invitation flows:

```tsx
vi.mock("@/shared/api/client", async (importOriginal) => {
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof import("@/shared/api/client")>()
  return { ...actual, apiFetch: vi.fn(), siteFetch: vi.fn() }
})
```

`importOriginal` is what keeps it a boundary mock: everything but the transport stays real.
Ten public and pre-authentication files use this form and five authenticated page tests use the
spy, and that split is the rule rather than drift.

**Render what the app renders.** A component that reads the URL needs a real router:
`withRouter` / `renderWithRouter` from `src/tests/router.tsx`. The router resolves its first
location asynchronously, so `await renderWithRouter(...)` or `flushRouter()` before asserting.
`src/tests/providers.tsx` re-exports the real provider tree for the tests that need it, and it
is the only module allowed to import `@/app`.

**Build fixtures from `src/tests/fixtures.ts`.** The builders fill a whole shape, which
matters because several code paths branch on `undefined` rather than zero
(`billedTokenTotal`, the share-card caveats): a hand-rolled partial fixture can pass a test
that the real response would fail.

**Drive with `userEvent`** and assert on what the operator sees, not on component internals.
One control needs a harness rather than `userEvent` alone: a `FilterSelect` is a HeroUI
`Select`, so `user.selectOptions` has no native `<select>` to drive. `pickOption` and
`selectTrigger` from `src/tests/select.ts` open its popover and click the option by its
visible label, and `selectTrigger(label).toHaveTextContent(...)` is what replaces
`toHaveValue` when asserting what the control currently shows. `pickOption` in
`e2e/helpers.ts` is the Playwright half.

**Wait on the event, not the clock.** `findBy*` and `waitFor` resolve the instant the DOM
changes; their timeout is a ceiling, not a sleep. Two habits that follow:

- Await the content, not its container. A wrapper can commit before its children do, so
  `await findByRole("tabpanel")` then a synchronous `getByText` inside it is a race. Await the
  text too.
- **A per-assertion `{ timeout: 5000 }` is a review blocker.** It hides which wait was slow.
  If the environment genuinely needs more headroom, raise it in one place
  (`configure({ asyncUtilTimeout })` in `src/tests/setup.ts`) and say why.

**Assert a class with `toHaveClass` or `[...el.classList]`, never `className` with
`toContain`.** A class list is a set of tokens and `toContain` on the string is a substring
match, so the assertion passes on any longer token that happens to contain the one you named:
`h-6` passes on `max-h-64`, `text-foreground` on `hover:text-foreground`, `border-l` on
`first:border-l-0`. Each of those false-passed a real assertion here, including a target-size
test that would have been satisfied by a button with no height. Negative assertions are the
exception and stay as substring matches on purpose: `not.toContain("bg-")` rejects more than a
token check would, which is the safe direction.

**Every test file is self-contained.** Vitest runs files in parallel across workers, so a
global one file leaves modified is a failure in another file that only reproduces at full
suite size:

- Restore any global you override (`window.location`, `matchMedia`, `localStorage`) in
  `afterEach`, and set `configurable: true` on every `Object.defineProperty` so the next test
  can redefine it.
- `vi.clearAllMocks()` and `localStorage.clear()` in `beforeEach`, not once at the top.
- `vi.useFakeTimers()` is always paired with `vi.useRealTimers()` in `afterEach`.
- Heavy polyfills go in the file that needs them. `src/tests/setup.ts` carries only what is
  universal (the jsdom gaps: `ResizeObserver`, `scrollTo`, object URLs).

**Keep test files small.** Vitest gives one file to one worker, so a 2,000-line file is the
suite's critical path while other workers idle, and `ActivityPage.test.tsx` is currently
exactly that. Split by concern (`Page.test.tsx`, `Page.deletion.test.tsx`,
`Page.filters.test.tsx`) when a file grows several independent `describe` blocks or needs
different mock setups per block.

### Never wait a component's timer out in real time

Two cases used to sleep through a real delay, and between them they were **10.6s
of a 22s suite**: `CopyButton`'s 1.5s confirmation dismissal, and the Activity
page's in-flight poll, which cost 9.1s because `useInFlightRequests` declares its
own `retry` (three attempts, since a 503 is a gateway restarting and worth
re-asking) and that overrides the harness's `retry: false`, so reaching the error
arm meant the 2s poll plus TanStack's 1s/2s/4s backoffs. Both now jump the clock
and run in 44ms and 85ms.

The pattern, which this tree already used in three places before it was applied
to these:

```tsx
vi.useFakeTimers({ shouldAdvanceTime: true })
try {
  const user = userEvent.setup({ advanceTimers: vi.advanceTimersByTime })
  // …
  await act(async () => {
    await vi.advanceTimersByTimeAsync(2_000)
  })
  expect(screen.queryByText("Copied!")).not.toBeInTheDocument()
} finally {
  vi.useRealTimers()
}
```

`advanceTimers` is the answer to the deadlock a previous note in `CopyButton`
described (a clipboard write is a promise, and fake timers stall userEvent's own
waits), so "real timers because userEvent deadlocks" is not a reason to sleep.
Use `advanceTimersByTimeAsync` when each tick triggers a fetch: the awaits
between timers are what let those promises settle and schedule the next one.

**Prove the conversion is not vacuous.** A fake-timer test that passes because it
no longer exercises anything is worse than a slow one. Break the behavior in the
component and confirm the test goes red before keeping it; both of the above were
checked that way (remove `CopyButton`'s reset, remove the `inFlight.isError` arm).

### A timeout expiring usually means a starved worker

`findBy*` and `waitFor` are wall-clock bound, and RTL's fake-timer path checks
for `jest` globals that do not exist under Vitest, so no amount of correct
awaiting makes them independent of machine load. Measured on a page test: the DOM
received the text at 204ms and `findByText` reported it at 209ms, so the notice
latency is ~5ms and the rest is genuine React work under jsdom. `vi.waitFor` on a
fetch-call array cost 1ms, and `userEvent.setup({ delay: null })` changed nothing.
None of those is the problem.

What does break is contention. Bisected at the default 1000ms, full suite: a cold
transform cache alone passes, CPU saturation alone passes (load average 50 on 14
cores), and the two together fail a random handful with
`Unable to find an element with the text ...`. So when one expires, suspect the
machine first: run the file alone (`pnpm --dir web test <file>`) before changing
anything about the component. `--maxWorkers=4` also clears it, at roughly 1.5x
the wall clock, if a machine needs that.

This has not been observed in CI, whose test step has been green across the last
25 runs of `otari-dashboard.yml`.

**`user.type` is where the remaining time goes, and it stays.** After the two
real-timer cases above were converted, the slowest tests are 400-800ms and are
dominated by typing: `user.type` fires roughly three events per character on a
controlled input, so the MCP URL-validation case spends most of its 717ms
re-rendering a form through 38 characters. `user.click` + `user.paste` is one
event instead, and would cut that, but it is 267 call sites across 29 files and
trades away the per-keystroke path a real operator takes. Deliberately not
done: `user.type` is one line and it is the library's own API. Revisit only if
the suite gets slow enough to be worth the churn, and measure one file before
committing to the rest.

## A combo box inside a dialog: Escape is not the way to close its popover

A form that lives in a `FormDialog` gives one keystroke two meanings, and the
habit that works everywhere else is the one that breaks. `{Escape}` after
picking an option is how a spec puts a react-aria popover away, because that
popover `aria-hidden`s the rest of the page and hides the control the spec
presses next. Inside a dialog the key travels on to the dialog, which either
closes it or, where the form is dirty, swaps the footer for its unsaved-changes
guard. The failure reads as a missing submit button, several lines below the
line that caused it.

This has cost a run on three pages: keys, routing and providers.

**What to do after a pick depends on `menuTrigger`, and the default is the
awkward one.** `ComboBoxField` defaults to `menuTrigger="focus"`, which
`UserComboBox` and `providerFields` also set explicitly. Selecting an option
hands focus back to the input, and a box that opens on focus reopens: the
popover is open again, the page is `aria-hidden` again, and the dialog's submit
is out of reach. So:

- **A `menuTrigger="focus"` box needs focus moved off it**, by clicking a named
  control inside the dialog: `await user.click(screen.getByLabelText("Name"))`
  is what the keys dialog does. Not a bare `blur()`, which lands straight back
  on the box because a modal contains focus, and reopens the popover for the
  same reason.
- **A `menuTrigger="input"` box needs nothing.** Its popover opens on typing,
  so the pick leaves it closed and there is nothing for a keystroke to do.
- **Where a spec has to dismiss without picking, send Escape only while the box
  reports `aria-expanded="true"`**, and check the attribute rather than waiting
  on it: a popover that is already closed satisfies a wait instantly, by which
  point the keystroke has landed on the dialog.
- **Query the submit through the dialog** (`within(dialog)` in Vitest,
  `page.getByRole("dialog").getByRole(...)` in Playwright). The labels rule puts
  the same words on the page trigger and on the dialog's submit, so an unscoped
  query is ambiguous while the dialog is open, and ambiguous again on an empty
  list where the empty state offers the same words a third time.
- **In Vitest, use one `userEvent` instance for the whole flow.** Mixing a
  fresh `userEvent.setup()` with the bare default drops the press: the submit
  reports as enabled, inside the form, and nothing happens. It reads exactly
  like a validation guard refusing, and it cost an afternoon being mistaken for
  one.

None of this applies to a combo box in a toolbar, which is what
`e2e/helpers.ts`'s `dismissComboBox` was written for: it presses Escape and
blurs unconditionally, and both are right outside a modal.

## Playwright: behavioral

`pnpm --dir web run e2e` builds the bundle and boots a real gateway against a throwaway SQLite
database (`e2e/serve.sh`). Three ordered projects share that one database, so a spec scopes
itself to the rows it owns rather than to a global count, and an open react-aria combobox
popover `aria-hidden`s the rest of the page, so `dismissComboBox` runs before asserting
anything outside it. `playwright.config.ts` carries the rest.

A fourth project, `hybrid`, runs against a second gateway booted in hybrid mode
(`e2e/serve-hybrid.sh`), because a deployment attached to a control plane elsewhere is a
different shape rather than a different page, and only a server can put the browser in one.
It shares no state with the three above. Two mechanical rules come with adding any spec here:
a file collected by no project's `testMatch`/`testIgnore` is dropped from the run with a green
exit, and `package.json`'s `e2e` script names each project it runs, so a project missing from
that list never runs in CI (`src/e2eProjects.test.ts` fails on that half). The gate is
`otari-dashboard-parity.yml`, triggered by `src/gateway/**` as well as `web/**`: these flows
are gateway-served end to end, so a backend change can break one with no file under `web/`
touched.

## Playwright: screenshots

`e2e/screenshots/` is the visual-regression suite. Each spec is captured by six projects,
three viewports (1920×1080, 1280×800, 390×844) times both themes, so one entry covers a page
at every size and in both palettes. **The configuration is otari-ai/frontend's**, ported
rather than reinvented, because the two suites fail for the same reasons and only one of them
should have to learn each one. Keep them recognizably the same file.

**Adding a page means adding an entry**, in the registry that matches how it is reached: a
route in `WORKSPACE_ROUTES` in `authenticated.spec.ts` for anything behind a session, a
test in `public.spec.ts` for anything in front of one, or a test in `hybrid.spec.ts` for
the hybrid landing surface. One entry buys six captures. A page with no entry is a page
whose mobile and dark rendering nobody checks.

What the harness already handles, so you do not work around it:

- **The mobile project is a phone**, not a narrow desktop: `isMobile`, `hasTouch`, a
  `deviceScaleFactor` and an iPhone user agent, so touch guards, viewport meta and `:hover`
  rules behave as they would on a device. Playwright captures at CSS scale, so the PNG is
  390 wide whatever the scale factor.
- **A frozen clock** (`page.clock.setFixedTime`), so anything the page reads off the browser
  clock renders identically every run. What a fixed clock cannot fix is a timestamp relative to
  a row the seed created at run time, which is why those are masked below. Deliberately not
  `clock.install`, which also fakes timers and deadlocks TanStack Query's refetching and
  React's scheduler.
- **Animations and transitions frozen** by injected CSS, the scrollbar hidden (its width
  differs between a laptop and the CI container, and it runs the height of a full-page shot),
  SVG timelines paused at t=0, fonts awaited, scroll position reset, and a few frames allowed
  to land before the shutter. That is `waitForStable` in `fixtures.ts`.
- **Pinned `locale`, `timezoneId` and `reducedMotion`** on the screenshot projects only, so
  date and number formatting cannot vary while the behavioral suite keeps its own behavior.
- **Two comparison budgets, not one.** `maxDiffPixels: 2000` alongside
  `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002`, because Playwright takes the smaller of the two and a ratio
  alone scales with page height: a tall full-page capture would earn an allowance big enough
  to absorb a whole changed paragraph. `threshold: 0.12` is the per-pixel color distance that
  counts as a difference at all, set high enough that antialiasing does not register as one.
- **Masks** over the two things still not reproducible here: recharts, which animates through
  JavaScript that neither the CSS freeze nor `animations: "disabled"` reaches, and relative
  timestamps, which move with the gap between the frozen clock and rows the seed created at
  run time. otari-ai needs neither, because its captures run against static mocked responses;
  ours will not either once they do.

If you find a third source of noise, mask it in `fixtures.ts` with a comment rather than
loosening the budgets for everything.

The suite depends on the `seed` project and deliberately not on `parity`. Some database state
is needed, but each parity flow removes what it creates, so the seed is the fixture; depending
on the flows as well only means one flaky behavioral test takes all 108 captures with it,
which is exactly what it did before this was narrowed.

**No baselines are committed yet, and the suite is not a gate.** The dashboard is
mid-migration onto the rehomed design foundation, so pages still move for good reasons: a
committed set would fail most PRs and churn in every diff. So the `screenshots` job runs only
on `workflow_dispatch`, `e2e/screenshots/*-snapshots/` is gitignored, and a PR that changes
how a page looks owes no PNGs.

What a PR does owe is the entry above, because that is what makes the page covered the day
this becomes a gate rather than the day someone remembers it.

Running it is still worth doing when you have changed a layout: `pnpm --dir web run
e2e:screenshots` captures every page at every size locally and leaves the PNGs beside the spec
that took them. Treat them as a rendering check, not a diff: a macOS capture renders fonts
differently from CI's Linux, so the two sets are not comparable. To get a Linux set (which is
also what a future baseline commit needs), run the workflow from the Actions tab or with
`gh workflow run otari-dashboard.yml --ref <branch>` and download the `screenshot-baselines`
artifact.

`pnpm --dir web run e2e:screenshots:update` is the deliberate-update form, and note the
missing `--`: pnpm forwards the separator and Playwright's CLI discards everything after it,
so `-- --update-snapshots` is a flag that silently never arrives.

Turning it into a gate later is three edits: add `pull_request` back to the job's condition,
drop the `.gitignore` entry, and commit the Linux set that run captures.
