# Components: HeroUI v3 + the shared UI primitives

The dashboard uses HeroUI **v3** (`@heroui/react`). v3 is a ground-up rewrite; v2 habits are
wrong here.

## v2 → v3

| Concern | v2 (wrong here) | v3 (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Import | `@heroui/button`, `@heroui/card` | unified `@heroui/react` |
| Provider | `HeroUIProvider` | none needed for these components |
| Structure | flat `Card`, `Modal` | compound: `Card.Header` / `Card.Content` / `Card.Footer` |
| Styling override | `classNames={{ slot: "…" }}` | `className` on the subcomponent directly |
| Change handler | `onValueChange` | `onChange` (v3 ignores `onValueChange` silently) |
| Click handler | `onClick` | `onPress` |
| Button intent | `color="danger"` | `variant="danger"` |
| Disabled | `isLoading` for disabled | `isDisabled` / `isPending` |

Real example from `shared/components/deprecated/StatCard.tsx`:

```tsx
import { Button, Card } from "@heroui/react";

<Card className="flex-1 min-w-[11.25rem]">
  <Card.Content className="flex flex-col gap-1 p-5">…</Card.Content>
</Card>

<Button size="sm" variant="danger" isDisabled={isPending} onPress={onConfirm}>
  {confirmLabel}
</Button>
```

`variant` values the dashboard uses: `primary`, `ghost`, `outline`, `danger`, `danger-soft`.
`secondary` and the other HeroUI v3 variants are available if a new need arises; stick to the
in-use set unless you're deliberately adding one.

## Customizing: which layer to reach for

**Start from a component, not from an element.** A HeroUI component (or one of the shared
primitives below) already resolves through the tokens and already carries its states: the
pointer, the focus ring, the disabled dimming and the press animation arrive with it and cost
nothing at the call site. A hand-rolled `<button>` or `<div>` starts from Tailwind's reset,
which is to say from nothing, so every one of those states becomes a class somebody has to
remember on every copy of that markup. The dashboard's own nav rail is the worked example: its
rows are a mix of router `Link`s, plain `<button>`s and HeroUI `Button`s, and the plain ones
answer the pointer with the default arrow, so the shared row string has to name
`cursor-pointer` itself, where a HeroUI `Button` takes it from `--cursor-interactive` and a
bare `<button>` takes it from no one. Reaching for a native element is sometimes right (a nav
row has to be the router's `Link`), but it is a decision that buys styling work, not a neutral
default, and it can buy behavior nobody asked for: `FilterSelect` was a token-styled native
`<select>` until the platform menu it draws (over the control, covering the button that opened
it) made it a HeroUI `Select`. The phone was the argument for keeping it native, and it did not
survive contact: at 390px the popover opens under the trigger, inside the viewport, and scrolls
to its last option, which is what the platform picker was supposed to be needed for.

Once you know what you are styling, there are four ways to change how it looks, in the order to
try them. HeroUI v3 supports all four (its styling guide lists `className`, data attributes,
render props, wrapper components built with `tailwind-variants`, and overriding its own BEM
classes inside `@layer components`), so this order is not about what is allowed. It is about
which one adapts: a variable follows a retheme and a theme switch, a wrapper or a utility
carries one decision to every call site, a prop is visible to the person reading the JSX, and a
stylesheet rule against a component's internals does none of those and has to be maintained
against a structure HeroUI never promised to keep.

**1. A variable: ours, or the library's aliased onto ours.** If the value is one of the design
system's roles, it is a token, and if the role is missing, add it rather than writing the value
down somewhere. If it is a value the library computes from a variable of its own, alias that
variable instead of overriding the rules that read it. This is HeroUI's own theming API, not a
trick played on it: its theming guide and `@heroui/styles`'s README both document the knobs, and
they are not only colors. `--radius` (with `--radius-xs` through `--radius-4xl` calculated from
it), `--field-radius`, `--spacing`, `--border-width`, `--field-border-width`,
`--ring-offset-width`, `--disabled-opacity`, `--cursor-interactive` / `--cursor-disabled` and
the `--scrollbar-*` family are all declared in `@heroui/styles/dist/themes/default/variables.css`
and `dist/themes/shared/theme.css`. Color already works this way here, because each theme block
maps `--surface`, `--accent`, `--focus` and the rest onto our `--color-*` tokens, which is what
makes a bare `<Card>` wear the palette. Geometry and interaction are the half nobody has
claimed: `globals.css` sets none of those, so a component's corner radius, its disabled dimming
and its pointer are all HeroUI's defaults. `--radius-2xl` is `calc(var(--radius) * 2)`, so a
16px arc a component draws is one alias away from being ours. Read the value out of
`@heroui/styles/dist` before concluding a rule is the only way to reach it. **Alias, never
consume:** the alias belongs in `globals.css` beside the color ones, and a rule or class
string of ours never spells `var(--cursor-interactive)` or `var(--radius-2xl)` at the call
site, because that points our own code at a namespace the library is free to rename.

Two things to get right when you set one. Scope it where the decision lives: with the theme when
it is system-wide, on a component's own root when it is local, and note that the second is our
extension rather than something either upstream guide demonstrates, so check what else in that
subtree inherits it. And **scope the variable the rule actually reads.** A derived custom
property is substituted where it is declared, not where it is used, so `--radius-2xl`, computed
at `:root` from `--radius`, keeps the root's value inside a subtree that redefines `--radius`.
Setting `--radius` on `.otari-table` changes nothing HeroUI draws from `--radius-2xl`; setting
`--radius-2xl` there does. See [design-tokens.md](./design-tokens.md).

**2. A wrapper first, then a utility, once the look repeats.** The second call site that wants
the same look gets one owner, not the same class list typed again, and both upstreams say the
owner is usually a component: HeroUI's styling guide points at a wrapper built with
`tailwind-variants` for a reusable extension, and Tailwind's own answer to duplication is that
"the best strategy is to create a component", with custom CSS reserved for when a partial "feels
heavy-handed". `DataTable` is exactly that wrapper: pages declare columns and rows and never
style a table. A value-shaped decision, rather than a markup-shaped one, is where a utility or a
shared class string comes in: the `@utility text-heading` family in `globals.css` carries the
type roles, and `navRowClass` and `NAV_TRANSITION` in `app/nav/rowStyles.ts` carry a shell row.
Two copies of a class list are two surfaces that are meant to match and will stop matching one
fix at a time, and the copy that missed the fix is the one somebody notices.

**3. The component's own API.** `variant`, `size`, `isDisabled`, `isPending`, `fullWidth`,
`isInvalid`, and on a compound component the `className` of the subcomponent that owns the part
you mean. Read the variants before assuming there is no prop for what you want: `Table.Root`
takes one, and its `secondary` is documented as no background, padding, or rounding on the
root, which is a prop for something `.otari-table` currently neutralizes by hand. Reserve
`className` for layout and positioning (`flex`, `gap-*`, `min-w-[…]`, responsive prefixes), not
for re-skinning something HeroUI already styles.

**4. Discouraged, and only when nothing above reaches it: a rule against the component's own
classes.** `.otari-*` is the namespace for it, in `design-system/design-system.css` when the
subject is a primitive's own DOM and in `globals.css` otherwise (see
[design-tokens.md](./design-tokens.md)), and some cases genuinely land here: a keyframe,
something that has to outrank an inline style, or a value the library paints in a place it gives
you no other name for. HeroUI documents the route rather than forbidding it, and Tailwind says
the same thing about custom CSS in general ("writing some custom CSS is totally fine when a
template partial feels heavy-handed"), so the bar is not permission. The bar is that a rung
above genuinely does not reach the value, and reaching a value is what the three above are for.
Write one when that is true and say so; do not write one because it is the shortest edit.

Three costs. A rule is per-selector rather than per-value, so it fixes the case in front of you
and leaves every other rule reading the same variable untouched. It is invisible from the call
site, so the next reader checks the component's props, believes them, and is wrong. And it
depends on structure the class names alone do not promise: HeroUI's slot classes are documented,
but which element paints a border, which cell is `:first-child`, and whether the body is
virtualized are not, and `.table__body tr:first-child td:first-child` is a selector written
against all three.

Two things about the cascade here, because both are easy to get backwards. HeroUI's styling
guide puts a global override inside `@layer components`, and Tailwind's own example of
acceptable custom CSS is in `@layer components` too; the rules in `globals.css` are
**unlayered**, which is what makes them win, and it is not their specificity that does it, so a
comment explaining an override by its specificity is describing the wrong mechanism. The other
half of being unlayered is that these rules also outrank `@layer utilities`, so a Tailwind class
at the call site cannot override one of them. That is worth knowing before you put a rule here
rather than in a wrapper: it does not just style the component, it takes the call site's ability
to restyle it away.

When you do write one, name in its comment which of the three rungs above does not reach the
value, so a reader can tell a deliberate last resort from a shortcut. **The comment goes on the
block of related selectors, not on every selector in it**: a table's column widths are one
decision written as nine rules, and nine copies of the same sentence is not the point. One
sentence heading the run is what the rule asks for.

A per-table block paired with `TableScrollFrame` is the sanctioned shape rather than a last
resort, so it owes the reader what the sizing is *for* rather than an argument for existing at
all. `globals.css:2731`'s "Key lanes stay fixed while the name absorbs the available width" is
the model.

## Check the shared primitives before hand-rolling

`design-system/` is a directory per design topic (`layout/`, `metrics/`, `feedback/`,
`forms/`, `actions/`, `data/`, `navigation/`, `indicators/`, `overlays/`), named after the
topic file in `web/design/` that documents each one. A new primitive is a file of its own in
the topic it belongs to, and it owes a `.stories.tsx` beside it.

`shared/components/` keeps the two directories that are not primitives: `access/`, which
renders what a deployment does not serve, and `deprecated/`, the three that must not be used
in new code. The split is the extraction contract in DESIGN.md: `design-system/` may import
nothing else under `src/`, so anything reading the transport, the deployment or a generated
type lives on the other side of that line.
`web/design/DESIGN.md` maps every export to its module.

The table below gives each need its module. These are hand-rolled rather than rehomed (they
predate the foundation and have no otari-ai counterpart), but they are on the semantic tokens
like everything else, so reuse them rather
than duplicating their markup. See [design-tokens.md](./design-tokens.md).

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Labeled metric tile | `KpiStrip` + `KpiCell` (`metrics/`). **Not** `StatCard`, which is in `deprecated/` |
| Error alert from an unknown thrown value | `ErrorBanner` (`feedback/`; pairs with `errorMessage(error)` from `feedback/errorMessage`) |
| Info/warning callout | `InfoBanner` (`feedback/`; `tone="info" \| "warning"`) |
| Page title + description + action | `PageIntro` (`layout/`) |
| Deleting a record | `ConfirmDialog` (`feedback/`), always, one row or a selection. A neutral `RowAction` or ghost `Button` opens it and the dialog carries the danger confirm; the delete's `isPending` and `error` go to the dialog, not to the page's `ErrorBanner`. See [actions.md](../../../web/design/actions.md) |
| Destructive action that deletes nothing (regenerate, archive, reset) | `ConfirmButton` (`actions/`; two-click arm/confirm), or `ConfirmRowAction` inside a table row |
| Filter over a small fixed option set | `FilterSelect` (`navigation/`; a HeroUI `Select`, so the list is a popover anchored under the trigger) |
| Filter over a large or open option set | `FilterMultiComboBox` (`navigation/`; type-to-filter, holds a set of values; `allowsCustom` when the value space is not enumerable) |
| Applied filters, each removable | `FilterChips` (`navigation/`); one chip per value, and pass `clearLabel` so several chips of one dimension stay distinguishable |
| Form field wrapper | `Field` (`forms/`), or `SecretField` for a credential |
| Tabular data | `DataTable` (`data/`), with `TablePagination` and `BulkActionBar` beside it |
| What stands where a request snippet would be, when the deployment named no gateway | `MissingGatewayAddressNotice` (`access/`); pairs with `resolveSnippetBaseUrl` answering `undefined` |
| Settings page section (header + body) | `SettingsGroup` (`layout/`). **Not** `SettingsSection`, which is in `deprecated/` and has no call site left |
| Table row's trailing icon-button cluster | `RowActionRow` (`actions/`). **Not** `RowActions`, which is in `deprecated/` |

### The divided surface's own vocabulary

The topic directories under `design-system/` hold the pieces the pages are built from. They are there rather
than in a feature because the second page to want one was the proof that it is the system
rather than that screen's layout, and because a copy per page is how two pages come to disagree
about what a thing is. Every one of them was extracted after the duplication had already
started: the settings list was spelled four times on one page at two different heading sizes,
the page header eight times with the same arbitrary type values.

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| A band of the page: rules to the edge, content in the column | `Section`, with `bleed={false}` when it is nested inside a column |
| Page title + description + one action | `PageIntro` |
| A heading between rules over rows on the page ground | `SettingsGroup` |
| A row of filter controls above a table | `Toolbar` (its controls take the dense field height; see design-tokens.md) |
| A table's scroll frame | `TableScrollFrame`, paired with a per-table block in `globals.css` |
| "There is nothing here" | `EmptyMessage` (`DataTable` already uses it) |
| A 6px status square | `Dot` |
| A KPI strip and its cells | `KpiStrip`, `KpiCell` |
| A spend against its allocation | `SpendMeter` (three states) and `spendState` |
| A share of something that is not spend | `Meter` |
| One of a row of segmented choices | `Tab`, `TabRow` |

Two of these carry a rule that is easy to lose at a call site and so is not left to one.
`SettingsGroup` owns the separator tier, and `Toolbar` owns the dense field height: a call site
says "this row is a toolbar", never "this control is 38px". Reach for the component rather than
reproducing what it does.

**A full-bleed row caps the measure of any prose inside it.** The band spans the page; the
sentence does not. `max-w-prose` is the default answer, and `PageIntro`, `SettingsGroup` and
`InfoBanner` already carry one, so this is about the prose a page writes itself.

`errorMessage(error)` centralizes turning an `ApiError`/`Error`/unknown into a display string;
use it rather than reaching into `error.message` yourself.

**When you add a shared primitive, add its row to that table in the same change.** The table
is only useful while it is complete, and duplication in this tree has never come from a
missing rule; it comes from not knowing the primitive already existed.

## Internal links go through the router

HeroUI's `Link` is a react-aria link with no knowledge of TanStack Router, so
`<Link href="/models">` triggers a **full page reload**: the bundle re-downloads, the query
cache is thrown away, and the bootstrap round trip runs again. For anything inside the app,
use the router's own link:

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router"

<Link to="/models" className="text-link hover:text-link-hover">Models</Link>
```

For a control that looks like a button, call `navigate` from a `Button`'s `onPress` rather
than nesting: `<Link><Button/></Link>` renders an `<a>` around a `<button>`, which is invalid
HTML and gives the two elements conflicting keyboard behavior. HeroUI's `Link` stays correct
for genuinely external destinations (documentation, otari.ai).

## Layout and spacing

- Space siblings with `gap-*` on the flex/grid parent, not `m-*` on each child. A shared
  component never bakes in its own outside margin: what sits between two things is the
  parent's decision, and a component that decides it cannot be recomposed.
- Arbitrary values are in `rem`, not `px` (`h-[20rem]`, not `h-[320px]`), so they follow the
  reader's root font size. A `1px` border is the exception; a `text-[11px]` is not, because
  that size is the `text-overline` role. See [responsiveness.md](./responsiveness.md).
- Responsive via Tailwind breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) and flex/grid; avoid fixed pixel
  widths for anything that should reflow (`min-w-[11.25rem]` on a wrapping stat card is fine:
  it is a floor, not a fixed width).
- One component per file for pages and standalone components, colocated with its test.
  That holds for the shared primitives too: a new one is a file of its own under the topic
  directory it belongs to.
