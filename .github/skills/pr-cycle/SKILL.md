# PR Cycle (otari)

Drive an issue from code to a reviewed, ready PR without hand-holding. One issue = one branch =
one PR. For several issues, fan out (see [Multi-issue orchestration](#multi-issue-orchestration)).

Compose with the sibling skills rather than repeating them: [`review`](../review/SKILL.md) for
the self-review, [`frontend-standards`](../frontend-standards/SKILL.md) before any `web/` edit
(its [testing.md](../frontend-standards/testing.md) is the dashboard's test guidance), and
[`backend-standards`](../backend-standards/SKILL.md) before any `src/gateway/` edit (its "Before
you finish" section carries the backend test bar). [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) owns the
repo-wide facts this skill leans on: the two runtime modes, the test notes, and the generated
artifacts.

## The cycle (one PR)

1. **Branch** off `origin/main` (`git fetch origin main` first). Name it `<type>/<slug>`
   (`fix/…`, `perf/…`, `refactor/…`, `docs/…`). Never push to `main`.
2. **Understand the issue.** Read it and the exact files and lines it names, and verify current
   signatures before editing rather than trusting the issue's snippet. Read `AGENTS.md` plus the
   scoped one for the directory you are in (`web/`, `src/gateway/`). A backend edit respects the
   layer rules `scripts/check_architecture.py` enforces; a management route is standalone-only,
   so check `register_routers()` placement.
3. **Implement.** For a refactor, keep it strictly **behavior-preserving**: no change to a
   public API, a route, a query key, or an invalidation. Correctness over speed.
4. **Tests.** Happy path and error path, next to the behavior they cover (unit for pure logic,
   integration for route or database behavior). Mock the dashboard at the `apiFetch` boundary,
   not the hooks. Never weaken coverage, and never add a global pytest rerun policy: a genuinely
   flaky test carries `@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=...)` and a stated reason.
5. **Checks** must be green before opening (see [Running checks](#running-checks)), and
   **regenerate whatever the change made stale** (see
   [Generated artifacts](#generated-artifacts-a-pr-can-owe)).
6. **Commit.** Conventional Commits. End every message with a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer naming
   the model that wrote it (`Co-Authored-By: <your model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`). Fill in your
   own identity; do not copy a model name out of an example or another commit.
7. **Open the PR** against `mozilla-ai/otari` with `Fixes #<n>`. The **title must be a
   Conventional Commit** (`otari-pr-title.yml` gates it; accepted types are `feat`, `fix`,
   `perf`, `security`, `revert`, `chore`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`),
   because the repo squash-merges and git-cliff parses that title into the changelog. A breaking
   change carries `!` after the type or scope; see
   [Breaking changes](../../../RELEASE.md#breaking-changes). Keep the
   template's `## PR Type`, `## Checklist` and `## AI Usage` sections: `pr-template-check.yml`
   fails and labels the PR `missing-template` if any of the three is absent. Fill in AI Usage
   honestly, including the AI-agent checkbox. Two further sections are expected on every PR
   and are gated by nobody, which makes them the ones an agent drops: `## Description` in
   plain English for a reader with no context on the area (what changes for someone using
   Otari, and why, no file paths), and `## How to test it locally` with the steps a reviewer
   runs plus the automated checks that already cover it. No labels are required here. No em
   dashes in the description (repo prose rule). Default to opening **ready for review**; open a **draft** only
   if the user asked to see it first (confirm which if unsure).
8. **Self-review.** Invoke the [`review`](../review/SKILL.md) skill on your own PR before anyone
   else reads it. Apply what is valid and push; skip nits that fight the repo's conventions, and
   say why.
9. **Request reviewers** (see [Requesting reviewers](#requesting-reviewers)).
10. **Wait for the review, then fix** (see [Handling the review](#handling-the-review)). Leave
    the PR ready (or draft, per step 7). **Never merge unless told to**, and note that `main` is
    protected as well (see [Merging](#merging-when-asked-to-merge)), so a merge needs a human
    approval on top of your instruction.

## Running checks

From the repo root:

- `make lint`: the architecture check, then Ruff. **Ruff alone is not equivalent.** A layer
  violation fails here with a clean `ruff check`.
- `make typecheck`: mypy.
- `make test`: `tests/unit` and `tests/integration`. `make test-unit` and `make test-integration`
  split it while iterating.

Integration tests need PostgreSQL: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` when set, otherwise a Testcontainers
`postgres:17`. Whichever it is, it is a *server* URL: each xdist worker creates a database of its
own on it (`postgres` becomes `postgres_gw0`, and so on) and drops it at the end of the session,
so the credentials need `CREATE DATABASE` and a `postgres` database to connect through. With no
Docker, point `TEST_DATABASE_URL` at any reachable instance; SQLite is not a fallback, because
none of that is available there. Two tests make a real outbound call and report a status mismatch
with no network egress
(`test_error_detail_leakage.py::test_provider_error_does_not_leak_details`,
`test_streaming_error_event.py::test_streaming_creation_error_returns_http_error`): that is
environment noise, not a regression, so confirm the change against the rest of the suite.

A change to the app, the migrations, or dependency resolution also owes the OSS-edition smoke
gate: `uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py`. It defaults to a throwaway
SQLite file, so it needs no Docker.

The dashboard has its own, which `make lint` does not touch: `pnpm --dir web run lint`,
`pnpm --dir web run typecheck`, `pnpm --dir web test`. Screenshot baselines are gitignored and
that suite runs on demand, so a PR that moves a page owes no PNGs; a PR that **adds** a page owes
a screenshot entry so the page is covered when the suite becomes a gate.

## What CI runs on a PR, and the two ways it silently does not

Every substantive workflow but one is declared `pull_request: branches: [ main ]`
(`otari-dashboard.yml`, `otari-dashboard-parity.yml`, `otari-design-system.yml`,
`otari-tests.yml`), and that filter is on the **base** branch. The exception is
`otari-sdk-codegen-check.yml`, which declares `pull_request` with a `paths` filter and no
`branches` key at all, so it matches any base: a stacked PR touching
`docs/public/openapi.json` or `scripts/sdk_codegen/**` runs its four-language generate matrix
and can go red where this section otherwise promises nothing. Two situations therefore leave a
PR with almost no CI, and neither of them reports anything:

- **A base that is not `main`.** A PR stacked on another feature branch matches no workflow, so
  it gets only the `pull_request_target` checks. Retargeting a stacked PR onto its parent branch
  is what usually causes this, and the trade is invisible in the direction you are looking: the
  diff gets smaller and the check count drops from seven to one or two. Both ends of that range
  depend on when you look, and it is worth knowing why: `otari-pr-title.yml` lists `synchronize`, so
  `Lint PR title` re-runs on every push and is attached to the current head, while
  `pr-template-check.yml` lists only `opened` and `edited`, so `check-template` stays attached to
  the sha the PR was opened (or last edited) at. So the ceiling is seven on that sha and six on
  every head after a push, and the floor is two and then one. Measured on four stacked heads: one
  row each, `Lint PR title`, with no `check-template` on any of them. Keep a stacked PR on base `main` and
  live with the inherited diff until its parent merges.
- **A `CONFLICTING` PR.** A `pull_request` workflow builds the PR's merge ref, and a conflicting
  PR has none, so nothing runs until the conflict is resolved. The tell is
  `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY` beside a check set that is not growing, and read that tell as "not
  growing" rather than as "small": a PR that was mergeable when its checks ran and conflicted
  afterwards keeps every one of those rows, so `DIRTY` beside a **complete** green set is the
  same fault from the other end. Checks attach to the SHA used by that workflow run, so nothing
  about them changes when the mergeability underneath them does; four PRs based on `main` but
  stacked in content showed a full green set for the parent's pre-merge state within a minute of that parent
  squashing. `DIRTY` plus finished means re-verify after the rebase, and until then the set says
  only that the content merged with an earlier `main`.

A child PR hits the second case as soon as its parent is squash-merged, because its own
unsquashed commits and the squash on `main` are the same content twice.
`git rebase --onto origin/main <the parent's old head>` drops the absorbed commits and clears it.

**"Green" means the PR is mergeable and the full expected set has passed**, not merely that
nothing is pending. A base other than `main` can produce a `gh pr checks` that lists only one or
two passing rows, which can look complete to someone who does not know what the set should be.
Check the names rather than only the buckets: on a dashboard change the substantive ones are `build`, `dashboard`, `e2e`, `catalog` and `serving`, and a run without
them has covered nothing.

A small set is not always one of the two faults above, though. Every one of these workflows also
carries a `paths` filter, so a change that touches nothing they watch correctly runs almost
nothing: a PR editing only `.github/skills/`, or a `docs/` file other than `dashboard.md` and
`public/openapi.json`, gets the title and template checks and no more, and that is the right
answer rather than a symptom. Those two `docs/` paths are the exception, watched by
`otari-dashboard.yml`, `otari-dashboard-parity.yml`, `otari-dashboard-serving.yml` and
`otari-docker-build.yml` because the dashboard bundles the guide and generates its client from
the spec, so a one-line edit to either runs `dashboard`, `e2e`, `serving` and `build`. The
question to ask is whether the set matches the change, not whether the set is large.

## Generated artifacts a PR can owe

- A route, a schema, **or a route docstring**: run `uv run python scripts/generate_openapi.py`,
  then `make postman`, and commit both. A single CI job runs `make openapi-check` and
  `make postman-check`, so regenerating only the spec still fails.
- `web/src/client/schema.ts` and `web/src/routeTree.gen.ts` are committed and drift-checked. The
  dashboard bundle (`src/gateway/static/dashboard/`) is not committed, so a `web/src` change
  sometimes leaves a file to commit and never leaves a bundle to commit.
- Never hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`. The release workflows regenerate it from the squashed titles.

## Requesting reviewers

**One bot reviews this repo.** **CodeRabbit** reviews automatically, without being requested,
and leaves inline comments of its own; address its threads the way you would a person's (reply,
then resolve). Nothing has to be requested to get it.

**Copilot is gone.** The org gave up its access in September 2026, so do not request it. The
attempt fails silently rather than erroring: `POST /pulls/<n>/requested_reviewers` returns
`201 Created` and GraphQL `requestReviews` returns success, both while adding no reviewer, so a
poll for its review waits out the timeout on a bot that was never coming.

- **Team.** `gh pr edit <n> --add-reviewer mozilla-ai/otari-team`. CODEOWNERS auto-requests that
  team only on the open-core guardrail paths it lists (`.github/CODEOWNERS`), so every other PR
  needs the request made explicitly. Once the `main` ruleset requires code-owner review, a PR
  touching one of those paths cannot merge on an approval from anyone else.

## Handling the review

1. **Wait for CodeRabbit to finish.** It appears under `/pulls/<n>/reviews` with state
   `COMMENTED` once done. It is not instant, and its summary comment can land before the inline
   threads do, so a review that looks empty may not be finished.
2. **Read the comments.** The summary body is in `/pulls/<n>/reviews`. **Inline comments can be
   missing from the REST `/pulls/<n>/comments` endpoint for bot reviews** even when the summary
   claims N comments, so fetch the threads over GraphQL:
   ```bash
   gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner:"mozilla-ai",name:"otari"){
     pullRequest(number:<n>){ reviewThreads(first:50){ nodes{
       isResolved isOutdated id
       comments(first:10){ nodes{ databaseId author{login} path line originalLine body } } } } } } }'
   ```
3. **Triage.** Apply every valid finding; skip a nit that contradicts an established convention
   here and say so. Verify against current source before "re-fixing" anything: GitHub re-anchors
   comments to HEAD, so an addressed comment can look like it came back.

   **When a finding is about a claim, grep the repo for the claim, not the file.** The habit worth
   correcting here is fixing the place the problem was noticed rather than every place it lives.
   One review caught the same stale statement in three files, a role whose color was checked and
   whose metrics were not, and one of two identical hand-rolled values in a file already being
   edited. Each fix was right and each search was one file too narrow, so after applying a finding,
   search for the pattern rather than re-reading the diff.
4. **Push** the fixes. On each addressed thread, **reply** with one line on how it was addressed,
   then **resolve** it:
   ```bash
   # reply: databaseId comes from the query above
   gh api -X POST repos/mozilla-ai/otari/pulls/<n>/comments/<databaseId>/replies \
     -f body='Addressed in <sha>: <what changed>.'
   # resolve: GraphQL only, with the thread's node id (there is no REST endpoint)
   gh api graphql -f query='mutation{ resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:"<threadId>"}){ thread{ isResolved } } }'
   ```
   A reply to a resolved thread does not reopen it. Keep replies terse and free of em dashes: it
   is a poor look to trip the prose rule in the same breath as answering a review.
5. **Resolve your own self-review threads too.** `required_review_thread_resolution` counts
   every thread, including the ones you opened on your own diff in step 8. Explanatory comments
   that need no action still block the merge until resolved, which is a non-obvious cost of doing
   the self-review properly. Resolve them once they have been read, the same way as a reviewer's.
6. Leave the PR ready (or draft, per the original decision).

## Multi-issue orchestration

To turn a batch of issues into PRs at once, run **one worktree-isolated agent per issue** (Agent
tool, `isolation: "worktree"`), each executing the cycle above.

- **Group into waves by file independence.** Issues touching disjoint files run in parallel;
  issues sharing a file are **sequenced**, with the later ones rebasing once the earlier lands.
- **Order within a wave:** small and low-risk first, large refactors later, so the rebase surface
  stays small.
- **A stacked PR loses three protections, so stack deliberately.** Basing a PR on a topic branch
  instead of `main` buys a clean diff (only your own commits, not the parent's) and costs the
  things that would otherwise catch a mistake. CI is the third and it has its own section above
  ("What CI runs on a PR"); the other two: `protect-main` applies to the default branch
  only, so the child reports `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` and can be merged into its base with **no
  approval and no thread resolution**, silently folding two reviews into one. And
  `.coderabbit.yaml` sets `base_branches: ["main"]`, so **CodeRabbit skips the child entirely**
  (it posts a "Review skipped" comment saying so); trigger it with a `@coderabbitai review`
  comment. Neither is a reason not to stack, and both are reasons to say in the PR body that it
  is stacked and what has to happen before the parent merges.
- **Branch shape.** Squash and rebase merges are enabled and **merge commits are disabled**, so a
  branch collapses to one commit on `main` and its internal shape never lands. Still update with
  `git rebase origin/main` and `git push --force-with-lease` rather than merging `main` in: the
  PR diff and CI stay about your change.
- **Poll for reviews centrally**, not inside each agent, since an agent idling on a review burns
  its run for nothing. Once a wave's PRs are open, poll until each has a completed CodeRabbit
  review, then route the fixes back to the original agents with `SendMessage` (their worktree and
  context are intact) rather than starting fresh ones.
- **Resource note.** Each agent running the integration suite boots its own Testcontainers
  Postgres. Stagger them rather than sharing one `TEST_DATABASE_URL`: two suites running at once
  against one server pick the same worker database names and drop each other's database out from
  under the run. Sharing a server is only safe if each agent gets a distinct database in the URL.

## Merging (when asked to merge)

- **Squash is the button** (merge commits are disabled). The PR title becomes the commit on
  `main` and the changelog line, so it has to be the sentence you want released.
- **Auto-merge is enabled** on the repo, so `gh pr merge --squash --auto` works while CI runs.
- **`main` is protected, by a ruleset rather than by legacy branch protection.** This matters
  because of how it looks from the API: `gh api repos/mozilla-ai/otari/branches/main/protection`
  returns **404 "Branch not protected"**, which is not evidence of no protection. It only means
  the rules are not the legacy kind. Read `gh api repos/mozilla-ai/otari/rulesets` instead, or
  `gh api repos/mozilla-ai/otari/branches/main -q .protected`, which reports `true`. An earlier
  version of this file claimed `main` was unprotected on the strength of that 404.

  The `protect-main` ruleset requires, on the default branch:
  - **one approving review**, and a bot's `COMMENTED` review does not satisfy it. CodeRabbit
    comments rather than approves, so a PR with its threads resolved and green CI still reports
    `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` and `reviewDecision: REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
  - **every review thread resolved** (`required_review_thread_resolution`). See the warning in
    [Handling the review](#handling-the-review) about your own self-review counting here.
  - **an extra approval for unattributed changes**
    (`require_extra_approval_for_unattributed_changes`). It keys on whether GitHub can attribute
    every commit in the PR to a user account, so a commit whose author email is not linked to one
    trips it. That matters here more than anywhere else in this file, because the subject is
    agents pushing commits: it presents as "green CI, one approval, still `BLOCKED`", which sends
    the reader back to the API. Avoid it by committing with an email linked to the account, rather
    than discovering it.
  - squash or rebase only, plus `deletion` and `non_fast_forward` rules on the branch.

  Repository admins are bypass actors, so an admin *can* merge through all of it. That makes the
  bar the one you hold yourself, unchanged: green CI, the review addressed, a human approval, and
  an explicit instruction to merge.
- **Branches are deleted on merge**, which makes the stacked-PR trap real. Merging parent A with
  its branch deleted **closes child B permanently**: B's base is gone and GitHub refuses to
  reopen a PR whose base branch was deleted (`422 "state cannot be changed"`), even if you
  recreate the branch. So `gh pr edit B --base main` **while A's branch still exists**, then merge
  A. Base `main` is also what gets B any CI at all (see
  [What CI runs on a PR](#what-ci-runs-on-a-pr-and-the-two-ways-it-silently-does-not)), so it is
  where a stacked PR should have been sitting all along. If B already closed this way, the only recovery is a fresh PR from B's head branch, linking
  the old one for its review history.

## Non-negotiables

- Never push to `main`; never merge unless told; confirm before any other outward-facing action,
  including posting a review or commenting on somebody else's PR.
- Every PR: `Fixes #<n>`, a Conventional-Commit title, the three template sections, and commit
  messages carrying a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer for the model that wrote them.
- A behavior-preserving refactor changes structure, not observable behavior. That is the bar.
- `make lint` before declaring done, not `ruff check`: the architecture check runs first and is
  the half that catches a layer violation.
