 * The organization-admin view of Spend & budgets.

 * `deployment_operator` is true and the route resolves to the other page every
 * time. Nothing else in this suite renders the admin page, which the frontend
 * standards owe a screenshot for.
 *
 * A seeded admin identity with a password would be the faithful way in, and this
 * harness has no password login: `login` is the only auth path and it is
 * master-key only. So the caller's own context read is stubbed instead, which is
 * the technique `public.spec.ts` already uses for the invitation pages. The two
 * organization-scoped reads are stubbed with it, because a master-key session is
 * still what the gateway sees and it would answer them for the operator's
 * organization rather than the shape this page is being captured for.
 *
 * What this does and does not cover: the layout, both themes and all three
 * viewports, which is what the matrix is for. It is not a claim that the role
 * gate works, which the vitest suite and the route tests own.

// No capture for the organization provider-key dialog. Its page is gated on the

// so the route answers with "Providers is not available here". Covering it
// would mean a third gateway in the harness rather than a test.
