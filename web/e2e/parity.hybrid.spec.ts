// A gateway attached to otari.ai is a data-plane runtime. Its organizations,
// credentials, routing, budgets and usage are owned there, so what it may show
// an operator standing at its URL is: is this gateway up, can it reach the
// control plane, and where do I go to change anything. Nothing else.
//
// Two halves of that are already covered elsewhere and are deliberately not
// repeated here: the component renders from a mocked bootstrap in
// HybridLanding.test.tsx, and every management router answering 404 with the
// "manage this on the platform" hint is asserted per path in
// tests/integration/test_hybrid_mode_surface.py. What only this suite can do is
// put the server's real answer and the real bundle in one browser, which is
// where a regression in either alone would still leave both green.
