# Motion and accessibility

## Durations

| Value | For |
| --- | --- |
| 100ms, ease-out | A control's color change (a button, a chip) |
| 150ms, ease-smooth | A rail row, a disclosure chevron, a knob's travel |
| 250ms, ease-out-fluid | A drawer or overlay sliding in |
| 0 | Everything, under `prefers-reduced-motion` |

**Every transition is guarded.** Write `motion-reduce:transition-none` beside every
`transition-*`. A vestibular disorder is not an edge case, and the guard costs one
utility.

**Two animations run indefinitely, and both are on the same surface**: the arc
sweeping the first-run sheet's own border (`Dialog`'s `isScanning`) and the orb
in the listening panel pinned above its footer. They are the shape of the
exception rather than licence to add more, and what makes them one exception
rather than two is that neither outlives the wait. Both run
only while the product is watching for a request that has not arrived, both stop
when it does, and neither carries anything that is not also in the text beside
it.

They stop differently under `prefers-reduced-motion`, because they are different
machinery. The arc is CSS, so it holds still on its last frame. The orb is a
canvas the stylesheet cannot reach, so `SetupOrb` reads the preference itself
and passes `paused`. Anything else that would animate forever is decoration. See
[feedback.md](feedback.md).

## Press

`scale(0.98)` at every size. One value, not a ladder: the ladder deepened with
size, so a wider button displaced further on a deeper value (0.57px at `sm`,
2.78px at `lg`, per edge). A full-width control does not press at all.

The pressed color step is what makes a flat transform enough. If a variant loses
its press color, the transform ladder has to come back with it.

## Focus

```css
outline: 2px solid var(--focus-ring-ink, var(--color-focus));
outline-offset: 2px;
```

Applied by a base rule on `:focus-visible`, so you get it for free. Two places need
the utility form (`focus-visible:otari-focus-ring`) because they reach into vendor
DOM: HeroUI's `.button` carries `outline-none`, and a checkbox's visual box is a
sibling of the element that actually takes focus.

The ring's ink is chosen by **the ground being ringed**, not by a list of
components: a control whose own fill is an accent or a status color takes the
theme's ink, everything else keeps `--color-focus`. Naming fills rather than
components is the point, because a list of variants goes stale silently the next
time someone builds a filled thing.

**Never remove a focus ring.** Never replace it with a box-shadow.

## Disabled

`opacity: 0.4`, product-wide, from `--disabled-opacity`. A disabled control has to
read as denied rather than merely quiet. The cursor is `not-allowed`.

Show a control disabled rather than hiding it when its absence would be confusing,
and only when it carries its own reason nearby.

## Cost

**Animate `transform` and `opacity`.** They are the two the compositor runs on its own,
without layout and without paint, which is what makes them smooth on a phone.

A property that changes geometry (`width`, `height`, `top`, `max-height`,
`grid-template-rows`) runs layout on every frame of the animation. That is sometimes the only
way to get the behavior, and then it is a decision with a reason in the rule's comment rather
than a default. Two in the tree, both deliberate:

- `.otari-detail-reveal` animates a grid track from `0fr` to `1fr` for 180ms, because the
  panel has to slide out from under its row without distorting its content or needing a magic
  `max-height`. No transform does that.
- `.otari-scan-border::after` interpolates `--scan-angle` into a conic gradient, which is a
  repaint per frame. `@property --scan-angle` is what makes it animate at all. It is bounded
  to one element on one open dialog.

**`will-change` is a loan, not a decoration.** It buys a compositor layer for an element that
is about to animate, and a layer costs memory for as long as the declaration is there. Add it
when an animation is about to start and take it off when it stops; a permanent `will-change`
is a permanent layer, and enough of them are slower than none. There are none in the tree
today, which is the right number until something is measured.

**Every animation answers `prefers-reduced-motion`.** Not customary here, required: the three
rules above all have an entry in the reduce block at the end of `design-system.css`, and the
scan arc's entry is the model for stopping motion without removing meaning.

## Touch

**44px is the floor, everywhere.** Express it as `min-h-11` (or a 44x44 flex box for
an icon-only control), not as padding, so a longer label grows the target instead of
breaking it.

Two ways a small visual keeps a large target:
- An icon glyph is 16px inside a 44x44 flex container.
- A 24px toggle track grows its hit area with a `before:` pseudo-element
  (`before:-inset-y-2.5`), absolutely positioned so the row does not move.

**One control is knowingly under the floor**, and it is the shape of the exception
rather than a licence to add more. `DismissChip`'s remove button is 24px, because
neither device above reaches it: its row wraps at an 8px gap, so a `before:` bleed
would overlap the row above and a press near the seam would dismiss the neighboring
filter, and a real 44px target grows the filter area on three pages. #947 carries
the decision. A new control under 44px needs the same kind of argument, in writing,
or it is a bug.

Hover is never the only channel. A hover state that carries information alone does
not exist on a phone: pair it with a fill *and* an ink change, as the rail rows do.

## Names

- Every icon-only control takes an `aria-label`.
- Every chart takes an `ariaLabel`; a chart without one is a picture.
- Every `Meter` takes an `ariaLabel`, because a bar has no text.
- A status is never color alone. `SeverityMark` ships a word beside the mark.
- `DataTable` takes a required `ariaLabel`, because "Table" is not a name.

## Cursor

`button`, `summary`, `[role="button"]`, `[role="switch"]` and `[role="tab"]` take
`cursor: pointer` from one base rule, keyed on what the element is rather than on a
class a call site has to remember. A disabled one takes `not-allowed`.
