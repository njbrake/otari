# Forms and controls

A field is white with a real 1px edge (`--field-border`, 0.48 alpha). On a white
page a fill alone leaves a field indistinguishable from what it sits on, so the
border is what makes it an object. HeroUI defaults `--field-border-width` to 0;
`globals.css` sets it to 1.

## Which control?

```text
Is it free text, a number, or a date?
 ├── Is the value a secret (a provider key, a password)?
 │    ├── Collecting one -> SecretField   (masked, never prefilled, autofill off)
 │    └── Handing one out -> CopyField, `concealed` (see actions.md)
 ├── Does it need more than one line?
 │    └── Yes -> TextArea           (a floor rather than a height; it grows)
 ├── Does it filter a list as you type?
 │    └── Yes -> SearchField        (type="search": Escape clears, own history)
 └── No -> Field
Is it a boolean?
 ├── Does it take effect on its own, without a Save?
 │    └── Yes -> Toggle             (role="switch", 44x24 track)
 └── No -> Checkbox                 (part of a form the operator submits)
Is it one of a short, closed set?
 ├── Does the choice filter a list on this page?
 │    └── Yes -> FilterSelect, or Segmented if there are 4 or fewer
 ├── Do the options need explaining, or does seeing them all matter?
 │    └── Yes -> RadioGroup         (vertical; past ~5 options use Select)
 └── No -> Select
Is it one of a set too long to scroll, or open-ended?
 └── ComboBoxField                 (search as you type; `allowsCustomValue`
                                    for a list that is a shortcut, not a whitelist)
Is it many of a set?
 ├── In a form -> MultiSelect
 └── In a toolbar -> FilterMultiComboBox
```

`Select` and `FilterSelect` are two components rather than one with a mode, and
the same is true of `RadioGroup` against `Segmented`. In both pairs the filter
half wears a caption label beside the control and never speaks a validation
message, where the form half puts its label above, keeps it visible, and owns a
description and an error announced on the control. One component serving both
would have a prop list mostly ignored at each call site.

```

`FilterSelect` renders `label` as visible text beside the control, which is what a
filter in a toolbar wants; `ariaLabel` is for the case where the visible label would
repeat what is already on screen. Pass one or the other, never neither.

`onChange` takes the **value**, never an event. `reserveMessage` defaults to off, so
a field in a form has to opt in; a field in a table row or a toolbar leaves it off.

`Toggle` used to say `checked` and `disabled` where every HeroUI-backed control
says `isSelected` and `isDisabled`, and this file called that a real
inconsistency rather than a typo. It closed when the control was rehomed into
the design system: two controls an operator reads as a pair should not need two
prop vocabularies, so `Toggle` now matches `Checkbox` exactly. `FilterSelect` is
the one still saying `disabled`, because it is a filter rather than a field.

## Field

```tsx
// Correct
<Field
  label="Key name"
  value={name}
  onChange={setName}
  placeholder="checkout-service"
  description="Lowercase, hyphens, no spaces."
  isInvalid={Boolean(error)}
  errorMessage={error}
  reserveMessage
/>

// Incorrect: a placeholder is an example, never a label. With the label gone the
// field has no accessible name and no name at all once the operator types.
<Input placeholder="Key name" value={name} onChange={setName} />
```

Rules:

- **The label is always visible and always associated.** `Field` wires it through
  HeroUI's `Label`, so never hand-roll a `<span>` above an `<input>`.
- Never add a manual `*` for `isRequired`. HeroUI marks it through CSS and you get
  two.
- `reserveMessage` holds one caption line open so an error does not move the form.
  On for a field in a form, off for one in a table row or a toolbar.
- An error message **replaces** the description line rather than adding a row.
- Inputs on public pages are 16px (`text-base`), which is what stops iOS from
  zooming on focus.

## ComboBoxField

`Select`'s vocabulary for everything the two share, plus what a combo box needs
beyond it. See its docstring for the contract; four things are worth knowing at
a call site.

**`value` is the option's `value`, exactly as in `Select`**, and the input shows
that option's `label`. The field never reports a label; the docstring says why.
`allowsCustomValue` is the one addition: text matching no row is reported as the
value too, as itself rather than as a lookup. So typing somebody's name names a
new id rather than resolving to theirs, which is what `description` is for
(`UserComboBox`'s `unknownHint` says the id will be created).

**It filters nothing.** `options` is what the popover holds, already matched and
capped by the caller, because what counts as a match differs per field (an id as
well as a name) and a ceiling wants a "showing 50 of 300" line under it.
`onQueryChange` is what the caller matches on: the field owns the input's text,
so it is the only thing that can publish it. It reports empty once a row is
picked, since the field is then showing a choice rather than a search.

**An empty popover has to say which empty it is.** Every combo box here keeps
its menu open on an empty collection, so that a query matching nothing does not
read as a broken field. `noMatchesMessage` is about the query and `emptyMessage`
about the source, `isSourceEmpty` picks between them, and only the caller knows
what would fill an empty source: `ModelComboBox` names the provider credential
that discovery needs. The two sentences are `ComboBoxEmpty`, which the comboboxes
that are not form fields render through `ListBox`'s `renderEmptyState`.

**An option's `hint` is a second, muted line inside the row**, for text that
identifies the label rather than repeating it, such as the id a person is billed
under. It joins the row's accessible name, since it is what tells two rows with
one label apart.

`FilterMultiComboBox` stays a separate component for the reason `FilterSelect`
does: it is a filter, so its label is a caption beside the control and it never
speaks a validation message.

## MultiSelect

**The form half of that pair.** It puts its label above the control, owns a
description and an error announced on it, and is the one to reach for inside a
`FormDialog`; `FilterMultiComboBox` is the toolbar one and stays.

Two behaviors are its own, and both were the bug it was built for. **The search
field never moves**: the chips render *below* it, so a growing selection pushes
the block down rather than shoving the control out from under the pointer. And
**a picked option stays in the list, checked**, so the list answers "who is in"
rather than only "who is left"; pressing it again removes it, and the order
never re-sorts on a pick.

`countNoun` is a pair, `{ one, other }`, because one noun interpolated into both
counts is how "1 people assigned" ships. `maxVisible` caps what is rendered,
never what is searched: the filter runs over every option and the footer says
when it is showing fewer.

An option's `hint` is the same thing it is on `ComboBoxField`: a second, muted
line inside the row, folded into the row's accessible name because it is what
tells two rows with one label apart. The query matches it too, so an operator
who knows an id reaches the row named for a person.


## Field height is a property of the place, not of the field

A field is **36px**. Inside a named dense place it is **32px**, and below `md`
every place raises it to **44px**, so the dense size is a desktop size the phone
layout takes back off. Three places exist:

| Place | Component that puts it on |
| --- | --- |
| `.otari-toolbar` | `layout/Toolbar` |
| `.otari-pagination` | `data/TablePagination` |
| `.otari-settings` | `layout/SettingsGroup`, and only with `bounded` |

`.otari-settings` differs from the other two in one way worth knowing: on a
phone its field also gains block padding and 16px type, where a toolbar's keeps
the dense 4px and 14px. That is because the row's control stops sharing the row
and stacks full width under its label there, so it is a form field again rather
than one of a strip of small ones, and iOS zooms the page when a field under
16px takes focus.

**No call site picks a height.** A page says "this row is a toolbar" and every
control in it agrees on a size, which is what stopped the six pages with a filter
row from each choosing their own.

The mechanism is worth knowing because it changed, and because the new shape is
the one to copy when adding a place. A place **declares two custom properties**:

```css
.otari-toolbar,
.otari-pagination {
  --field-height: 32px;
  --field-padding-block: 4px;
}
```

and the rule that reads them sits on `.input` and `.select__trigger`, because it
has to reach inside HeroUI's own DOM to find a select trigger. Adding a place is
therefore those two lines plus a class on the container, and `.otari-settings`
is the one that proves it: it arrived written the old way and converting it
moved no pixel, measured in all three places at both widths. It used to be
spelled the other way, as `.otari-toolbar .input { height: 32px }`, which worked
and had two costs. It was invisible from the call site: nothing on `<Toolbar>`
said it restyled the controls inside it. And it was unconditional, because a
descendant selector at (0,2,0) outranks anything a nested component can say about
its own field, so a control that legitimately wanted the form height inside a
toolbar had no way to ask. **A custom property inherits instead of winning**, so
the place still sets the density for everything inside it and any subtree can
reset it.

Adding a place is therefore two lines of CSS and a class on the container, and
`foundation.test.ts` holds the pair that matters: the dense value exists, and the
767px rule that undoes it exists. Drop the second and a phone gets a 32px search
box.

Two things are deliberately *not* places. `.table__cell .select__trigger` stays a
descendant selector, because a cell is HeroUI's own DOM rather than a place of
ours and a select is the only control that renders in one; making it a place
would pin a height on an `.input` a future cell might hold. And a bare
`input[type="search"]` outside a toolbar is untouched: the only two in the tree
are toolbar search boxes, and a native element carries none of HeroUI's classes,
so it reads the property through a rule of its own scoped to the place.

## Validation timing

Validate on submit and on blur. Never on the first keystroke: a message that
appears while someone is halfway through typing their own key name is telling them
they are wrong before they have finished being right.

On an autosaving page (see [layout.md](layout.md)) blur is also the commit, so
the two coincide: a text field validates and saves when it is left or when Enter
is pressed, and only if the value changed. A select saves on change, having
nothing typed to lose. Success is silent; a refused save keeps the value that
caused it, marks the control `aria-invalid`, and puts the message in the row
through `SettingRow`'s `error`. `useAutosave` owns that state, one instance per
control, and its `isSaving` is what disables the control mid-write.

## Toggle

`Toggle` is `role="switch"` with an `aria-label` (its `label` prop, since a
switch has no visible text of its own). The visible track is 44x24 with a
1px edge, filled with the page ground rather than a surface step: on a flat plane
the track is a drawn outline, not a raised trough, so the state is carried entirely
by the knob's color (`control-thumb` off, `control-indicator` on).

The knob travels with `transition-transform`, not `transition-colors`: the fill
should read as instant, the travel is what benefits from being followed.

## Checkbox

One visual serves both the standalone checkbox and a `DataTable`'s selection box
(`CheckboxVisual`), so the two cannot drift apart. Built on react-aria rather than
HeroUI's own, which splits the control across subcomponents.

The box fills with `--color-control-indicator` and the mark is
`--color-accent-glyph` (white). That mark is a graphic at a 3:1 floor, not text at
4.5:1, which is why it is white where text on the accent is near-black.

Pass `ariaLabel` when the visible label repeats across the page (one workspace list
per guardrail, say). Keep the visible text inside it so speech input still reaches
the control.

Pass `description` for help text under a checkbox rather than a sibling paragraph:
it is linked to the control, so a screen reader announces it with the label.

## Buttons in a form

One `primary` at the foot of the group it saves. See [actions.md](actions.md).
Never a floating page-level Save; see [layout.md](layout.md).

## Control rows

A row of controls laid out `items-end` bottom-aligns each child's whole box, and a
field's box includes the caption line it reserves. These rows also wrap, and
`items-end` aligns each flex line to its own cross-end. So the trailing caption rung
is a property of the flex line, not of the control: in a control row every child
holds one caption line whether or not it speaks, the trailing action included. In a
stacked form the opposite holds, and a control that can never speak holds nothing.

Wrap a trailing action in `FieldAction`, which gives it that rung and nothing above
it. Reserve the line rather than nudging the control: a local `pb-*` on one child
guesses a number, and the guess is wrong the moment the caption is retuned.

```tsx
// Correct
<FieldAction>
  <Button variant="ghost" onPress={remove}>Remove</Button>
</FieldAction>

// Wrong: a hand-tuned nudge that does not track the caption
<Button variant="ghost" className="pb-2" onPress={remove}>Remove</Button>
```

A field whose action submits it is the one row `FieldAction` cannot answer: its
message is a sentence long enough to wrap, and a wrapped message makes that field
taller than the reserve the action holds. Put the button inside the field instead,
beside the input, and let the message sit under both.

```tsx
// Correct: one row for the input line, the message under the whole field
<TextField className="flex max-w-2xl flex-col gap-1">
  <Label className="text-body">Name</Label>
  <div className="flex flex-col items-start gap-3 sm:flex-row sm:items-center">
    <Input className="w-full max-w-md" />
    <Button type="submit" variant="primary">Add a passkey</Button>
  </div>
  <FieldMessages>
    <Description className="text-muted">Optional, and only a label.</Description>
  </FieldMessages>
</TextField>
```

The input keeps `max-w-md`, the house field width; the wrapper is widened to hold
the input, the gap and the button, so the field does not narrow to make room. The
`items-start` is what keeps the button its own width once the row stacks: a column
stretches its children by default, and a full-width button does not press (see
[actions.md](actions.md)). The input carries `w-full` so the stretch it wanted is
still the width it gets.
