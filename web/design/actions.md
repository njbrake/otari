# Buttons

Use a `Button` for an action. Navigation that looks like a button is a `Link`.
An action inside a table row is a `RowAction`, not a `Button`, and it wears a
glyph rather than its word (see [A row's actions are glyphs](#a-rows-actions-are-glyphs)).

## Three variants. Nothing else exists.

`variant`: `primary`, `ghost`, `danger`.

`secondary`, `tertiary`, `outline` and `danger-soft` are retired.

**Import `Button` from `@/design-system/actions/Button`, not from
`@heroui/react`.** It is the same component with the union narrowed to the three,
which turns this rule into a compile error at the call site. Against HeroUI's own
`Button` a retired name is *not* a type error: all seven still typecheck, and a
retired one compiles, lints, ships, and paints an unstyled button.
`src/styles/foundation.test.ts` catches that by scanning the source, which works,
but reports it at the end of a test run rather than in the editor. That gate
stays, because it still covers the direct imports this tree has not converted;
new code should not need it.

`ghost` is the wrapper's default, which is the direction the "one primary per
band" rule wants the friction to point: the accent has to be asked for.

- `primary`: the one thing a band exists to do. **One per band** (see the rule under
  the flowchart, which is the part people get wrong). Filled teal under white ink.
- `ghost`: everything else. Transparent, with a 1px opaque edge. It absorbed
  `outline`, `secondary` and `tertiary`.
- `danger`: irreversible or hard to undo. **Unfilled**: transparent ground, danger
  ink, danger edge, filling to `--color-danger-subtle` on hover. A filled
  destructive button read as a second primary, which is the whole reason it is not
  one.

```text
Is it the single thing this band is for?
 ├── Yes -> variant="primary"          (two in one band means the band has no hierarchy)
 └── No
      ├── Does it delete a record?
      │    └── Yes -> a neutral trigger that opens a ConfirmDialog (see below)
      ├── Is it destructive or hard to undo, but deletes nothing?
      │    └── Yes -> variant="danger", and reach for ConfirmButton
      └── Default -> variant="ghost"
```

**"One per screen" means one per band, not one per route.** A page with a
`PageIntro` action and a `SettingsGroup` Save has two primaries, and that is
correct: each is the one thing its own band is for, and the bands are read one at a
time. The rule is about two primaries competing inside the same band, which is what
leaves a reader with no idea which control the band wants. When two do land in one
band, the secondary one becomes a ghost.

```tsx
// Correct
<Button variant="primary" onPress={create}>Create key</Button>
<Button variant="ghost" onPress={exportCsv}>Export CSV</Button>

// Incorrect: "outline" is retired. This compiles, lints, ships, and paints
// an unstyled button.
<Button variant="outline" onPress={exportCsv}>Export CSV</Button>
```

`Button` takes `isPending` while a mutation is in flight. **It draws no spinner**,
whatever this file used to say: HeroUI puts `data-pending` on the element and the
stylesheet answers that with `pointer-events: none` and nothing else, so the
spinner is the call site's to render. What `isPending` does supply is the press
block, `aria-disabled`, and react-aria's announcement, and it paints the button
at the disabled 0.4. Do not pair it with `isDisabled` for the same condition.

Which means `isPending` is the wrong prop wherever the button should read as
*working* rather than *refused*, since 0.4 is the denied treatment
([motion-and-access.md](motion-and-access.md)). `FormDialog`'s submit is the
worked example: it keeps its fill, blocks its own press, and says `aria-busy`.

## Where a create action lives, and what it says

Two rules, and both are "always the same" rather than "usually". The dashboard
had the action in a page's top right on one route and halfway down another, and
pressing it opened a modal on one and appended a section on the next, so an
operator learned each page separately.

**Placement: the heading row of the collection being created into.** When the
page is one collection that is `PageIntro`'s `action` slot; when the page holds
several it is the section's own heading row, right-aligned, the same button. An
empty state may repeat the call to action, and it opens the same dialog. The
header button does not hide while the form is open: the form is a dialog now, so
there is nothing for hiding it to prevent.

**Surface: `FormDialog`, every time.** See [feedback.md](feedback.md).

**Labels: the trigger and the submit are the same string, word for word.** The
dialog's title names the object instead.

| Trigger | Title | Submit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create key | New key | Create key |
| Add MCP server | New MCP server | Add MCP server |

**Create or Add** is not a style choice: *create* is for an object born here (a
key, a budget, a policy, a workspace), *add* is for attaching something that
already exists elsewhere (a provider, a provider key, an MCP server, a member,
an override, a ceiling). *Invite* and *Claim* keep their own verb, because
neither is either of those.

```tsx
// Correct
<PageIntro title="API keys" action={
  <Button variant="primary" onPress={openCreate}>Create key</Button>
} />

// Incorrect: a second vocabulary for the same act, and a title that restates
// the button instead of naming what appears
<Button variant="primary" onPress={openCreate}>New key +</Button>
```

## Sizes

`sm` 32px, `md` 36px (the default), `lg` 40px. Press is `scale(0.98)` at every
rung, and a full-width button does not press at all: a wide element displaces too
far for the same scale.

## Places: where a ghost drops its edge

An edge that would be too loud is suppressed by **naming the container**, so a call
site never has to remember. Inside one of these, a ghost renders edgeless:

`.otari-toolbar` · `.otari-table` · `.otari-pagination` · `.otari-bulk-bar` ·
`.otari-breakdown` · `.otari-rail` · `.otari-setup-actions` ·
`.otari-auth-actions`

`.otari-setup-actions` is the one that holds a single button rather than a row:
the first-run sheet's Skip, which is the screen's one way out and is quieted on
purpose so it does not compete with the request the screen is asking for. A lone
button is otherwise not a reason to name a container.

`.otari-actions` groups inline actions or a list of suggested actions. It drops
ghost edges without imposing the field density of a filter toolbar.

`.otari-auth-actions` is the public auth pages' footer row, and it is the one
place that does more than drop the edge. The row is text links plus a single
button, which is a button only because a popover trigger has to be a react-aria
pressable (`AuthHelp`), so there the ghost also takes the links' ink and their
44px height. That is why it is not `.otari-actions`: giving the link ink to
every inline action row would restyle pages that want a button to read as one.

Put the class on the container, not on the button. If you are building a new
container that holds a row of ghosts and the edges read as a grid of boxes, add a
place rather than styling the buttons.

Two of those places carry a second job, field density, and
[forms.md](forms.md) has that half: `.otari-toolbar` and `.otari-pagination`
declare `--field-height` for the controls inside them. Worth reading before
adding a place, because the density half is a custom property the place declares
rather than a rule reaching into its descendants, and a new place should be
written the same way.

**An icon-only ghost never takes the edge**, and that rule is keyed on what the
control *is*, not where it sits: `CopyButton` renders in tables, panels, banners and
bare pages, so no container can reach it.

## A row's actions are glyphs

**Pass `icon` and `label` to a `RowAction`.** A lane of words is prose the reader
has to parse before they can act, and it repeats on every row: four words per row
is four words to re-read down the length of the table (otari-ai#2123). Four shapes
are recognized instead.

`label` is not optional beside an icon, and it is not a caption either: it is the
accessible name *and* the tooltip, so the word is still read aloud, still matched
by speech input, and still spelled out on hover. A glyph with no name is anonymous
to a screen reader and unreachable by voice.

```tsx
// Correct
<RowActionRow>
  <RowAction icon={FiClock} label="History" onPress={toggleHistory} />
  <RowAction icon={FiEdit2} label="Edit" onPress={openEdit} />
  <RowAction icon={FiTrash2} label="Delete" onPress={() => setPendingDelete(row)} />
</RowActionRow>

// Incorrect: the glyph is named nowhere, so the control has no name at all
<RowAction icon={FiTrash2} ariaLabel="" onPress={remove} />
```

Where the text form is still right: **the armed half of a confirm**, whose whole
job is to name the consequence of the next press, and a lane whose actions have
no convention to borrow. A lane does not go half words and half glyphs, so if one
action in it has no glyph, ask whether the lane wants words.

The glyphs, so the same act does not arrive as two shapes on two pages:

| Act | Glyph | Act | Glyph |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Edit, Rename | `FiEdit2` | Delete | `FiTrash2` |
| Remove from a group | `FiUserMinus` | Remove a grant | `FiUserX` |
| Revoke an invitation | `FiXCircle` | Grant operator access | `FiShield` |
| Block, Deactivate | `FiSlash` | Unblock, Reactivate | `FiCheckCircle` |
| Disable | `FiPause` | Enable | `FiPlay` |
| Regenerate | `FiRefreshCw` | Archive | `FiArchive` |
| Restore | `FiRotateCcw` | Make default | `FiStar` |
| History | `FiClock` | Examples | `FiList` |
| Test | `FiActivity` | | |

Two splits in there are the vocabulary rather than a coincidence, and both are
worth keeping: **an X takes something away, a strike turns something off.** So
removing operator access is `FiUserX` while deactivating the account is `FiSlash`,
and `FiSlash` then means the same thing on Accounts (Deactivate) as it does on the
roster (Block). A toggle carries its state in the glyph, not only in the label,
which is what lets a reader see which rows are stopped without reading a lane.

**The geometry is 32px of visual and 44px of target**, the pair `CopyButton`
already uses in these rows: the `before:` bleed is the device
[motion-and-access.md](motion-and-access.md) names for keeping a small glyph
reachable, and 6px each way is under half `RowActionRow`'s 16px pitch, so no two
targets overlap. `RowAction` owns both, and the glyph's size with them, so a lane
cannot be built out of step with the next one.

**A disabled glyph gets a native `title` as well as its name.** A disabled control
takes neither hover nor focus, so react-aria's tooltip never opens on one, and the
pointer is the one reader an `aria-label` does not reach. `RowAction` adds it for
the disabled case only: on a pressable action the browser's tooltip and the
product's would open on the same hover and say the same thing.

An `actions` column's width is the widest lane it can reach, and for a lane with a
two-step confirm in it that is the **armed** state rather than the glyphs: arming
one row must not reflow the table. `.otari-provider-keys-table` is the one sized
that way.

## Deleting a record: a dialog, never an in-place confirm

**Every delete of a record goes through `ConfirmDialog`** (otari-ai#2110), whether
it deletes one row or a selection of them. The trigger is a plain `RowAction` or a
ghost `Button` that only opens the dialog, and the dialog carries the danger
confirm. A confirmation that armed inside the row read as part of the table rather
than as a decision, and it had nowhere to put the consequence: the sentence that
says what the deletion costs does not fit on a row action.

```tsx
// Correct: a neutral trigger, and the decision in the dialog
<RowAction onPress={() => setPendingDelete(row)}>Delete</RowAction>
…
<ConfirmDialog
  isOpen={pendingDelete !== undefined}
  onOpenChange={(open) => {
    if (open) return
    setPendingDelete(undefined)
    remove.reset()
  }}
  heading="Delete rate override"
  body={pendingDelete ? `${pendingDelete.model_key} returns to the catalog rate…` : null}
  confirmLabel="Delete override"
  isPending={remove.isPending}
  error={remove.error}
  onConfirm={…}
/>

// Incorrect: the confirmation arms in the row, so the decision reads as a cell
<ConfirmRowAction confirmLabel="Delete" onConfirm={remove}>Delete</ConfirmRowAction>
```

`pendingDelete` holding the target row (`undefined` when closed) is the idiom, and
the mutation's `onSuccess` clears it. The dialog owns `isPending` and `error`, so
the page's own `ErrorBanner` drops the delete: a message behind the backdrop is a
message the operator does not read. See [feedback.md](feedback.md).

**Reset the mutation when the dialog closes.** A refusal stays on it until the next
call, and the dialog reads it on open, so without this the next row's confirm opens
already reporting a failure that was about the row before it. On close rather than
on open, so the trigger in the row stays a bare `setPendingDelete` and a memoized
column keeps its per-row cache.

The dialog names the object and the consequence, and its confirm names the
consequence rather than repeating the trigger's word: "Delete permanently", not
"Delete" under a "Delete".

## The two-step destructive confirm

For a destructive action that **deletes nothing**: a regenerate, an archive, a
reset to a default. `ConfirmButton` at page level, `ConfirmRowAction` in a table
row. Both arm on the first click and destroy on the second.

The resting trigger is **neutral** and the armed confirm is danger. The first click
is safe, so spending the loudest signal in the product on it wastes it; the danger
hue marks the irreversible step.

In a row the trigger is a glyph and the armed half is words, which makes the
escalation structural before it is chromatic: a shape becomes a sentence.

Label the two steps differently: the trigger names the object, the armed confirm
names the consequence.

```tsx
// Correct
<ConfirmButton confirmLabel="Reset to default" onConfirm={reset}>
  Reset price
</ConfirmButton>

// Incorrect: the same word twice tells the operator nothing about what changed
<ConfirmButton confirmLabel="Reset" onConfirm={reset}>Reset</ConfirmButton>
```

**The Cancel that appears when armed is load-bearing. Do not simplify it away.**
The escalation is hue-only, and hue is the one channel a red-green deficiency
removes: measured, the ghost edge against the danger edge is 1.17:1 in light and
1.11:1 in dark, and 1.03:1 under simulated protanopia. What survives is structural:
a second control appears and the row's layout changes, which no color deficiency
hides.

## Other action shapes

| Component | Props | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RowAction` | `icon` + `label`, or children; `onPress`, `isDanger?`, `isDisabled?`, `ariaLabel?` | An action in a table row. A glyph by default, not a `Button` |
| `RowActionRow` | children | The trailing lane those sit in. **Use this one** |
| `RowActions` | children | A near-duplicate with a tighter gap, on 2 call sites. Do not reach for it in new code |
| `ConfirmButton` | `confirmLabel`, `onConfirm`, `isPending?`, children | The page-level two-step confirm, for a destructive action that deletes nothing |
| `ConfirmRowAction` | `confirmLabel`, `onConfirm`, `isPending?`, and `icon` + `label` or children | The same two-step inside a row. Its trigger takes a glyph; its armed half stays words. It supplies its own `isDanger` and its own Cancel. Not for a delete |
| `RefreshButton` | `onRefresh`, `isFetching?`, `updatedAt?`, `label?` | A refetch, with its own freshness caption. Pass `updatedAt` or the caption reads nothing |
| `CopyButton` | `value`, `label` | Copy one value. Icon-only, 44x44 hit area |
| `CopyField` | `label`, `value`, `multiline?`, `concealed?`, `action?` | A readonly field of a value to paste elsewhere. `concealed` is what it shows until the operator asks for the value, for a credential: Copy copies the real one either way, so a key is handed over without being read off the screen |

API-key handoff fields start concealed, showing the first eight and last four
characters. That stand-in is `concealedFingerprint`, beside `CONCEALED_SECRET`
in the same module, so its shape is decided in one place rather than rebuilt at
a call site. Copy and reveal are adjacent icon controls inside the field, each
a 44x44 target below `md`. Copy uses the full value in either state; request
examples share the reveal state and the same stand-in, so one credential never
wears two on a screen.
