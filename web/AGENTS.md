# Web dashboard (`web/`)

`web/CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import. Edit this file and never
replace or remove the import.

Before changing the dashboard, read
[frontend-standards](../.github/skills/frontend-standards/SKILL.md) and the one
topic guide it points to for the work at hand.

## Design system

[design/DESIGN.md](design/DESIGN.md) is the design system: what to reach for, which
variant applies where, which token layer is allowed, and which components exist but
must not be used in new code. It is eleven short topic files, so load only the one
covering what you are building. Written for a reader who cannot ask a question,
which is what an agent is.

The Paper file `Otari / Neat shell` is the visual reference for the same system:
foundations, components with their states, and the page archetypes as artboards.

## Runtime contract

`src/main.tsx` fetches unauthenticated `GET /api/v1/bootstrap` before mounting
React. Do not guess a deployment when that request fails.

A gateway older than a bootstrap field does not send it, whatever the generated
type promises, so `App` completes the payload once through
`shared/helpers/bootstrap.ts` before anything below reads a field. Add a field
to the bootstrap and that module stops compiling until it is given a default.
The two fields naming the deployment take none, for the reason above.

The bootstrap selects standalone, hosted, or hybrid presentation and publishes:

- sign-in methods and configured OAuth providers
- management surfaces hosted by this process
- the control-plane or data-plane URL
- documentation, mail, passkey, and maintenance state

Features read this through `useDeployment()` and `useSurfaces()`. Page
components do not branch directly on the mode. A surface gate controls
discoverability; backend authorization remains mandatory.

Local sign-in exchanges a master key, password, passkey, or OAuth assertion for
an HttpOnly session cookie. Do not store credentials or copy the cookie into
JavaScript state.

Public auth and invitation flows render ahead of the authenticated router in
`DeploymentRoot`. Their URLs are backend contracts used by email and OAuth
redirects, so changing one requires changing the producer and its tests.

Request snippets use `shared/helpers/requestSnippets.ts`. Standalone and
hybrid use the browser origin; hosted uses the bootstrap's `data_plane_url`.
A missing hosted data-plane URL renders no runnable snippet.

## Source layers

Biome enforces these dependencies:

| Layer | May import |
| --- | --- |
| `design-system/` | **nothing under `src/`.** React, HeroUI, react-aria, react-icons, recharts, react-markdown, and itself |
| `shared/` | `design-system/`, `client/`, and itself |
| `features/` | `design-system/`, `shared/`, `client/`, and other features |
| `app/` | any dashboard layer |
| `routes/` | feature pages and shared composition |
| `tests/` | any layer |

`design-system/` is the odd one, and its rule is the inverse of the others: they
name the few layers a layer may not reach, it names all of them. The question it
answers is not "does this import point the wrong way" but "would this directory
still compile with the rest of `src/` deleted", because it is the one layer here
meant to leave as a package. See [design/DESIGN.md](design/DESIGN.md), "The
extraction contract", for what that buys and what it costs; the probes are in
`src/architecture.test.ts`.

Do not import an overlay tree from the base dashboard. Otari.ai composes its UI
through the explicit overlay seams.

## Navigation

`src/app/nav/registry.ts` owns sidebar navigation. Items can be gated by:

- `surface`, the deployment topology
- `capability`, the installed or entitled feature
- `operatorOnly`, deployment-wide authority

These gates combine with AND. Organization and workspace authorization still
comes from server responses.

The workspace and organization rails have separate registries. A sidebar item
points to a real page, never a redirect. `/playground`, `/docs`, and `/account` are chrome
destinations and do not belong in a rail.

Overlay navigation uses the empty seam modules under `src/app/nav/` for new
sections, items inserted into base sections, and label overrides. Keep their
types aligned with otari-ai.

Three more seams let a build whose one dashboard reaches several deployments
say which: `shared/api/overlayRequestPolicy.ts` (the origin and credential every
management request uses, settled before the bootstrap is read),
`features/auth/overlayPublicAuthFields.tsx` (a control above the address on the
pages that post one), and `app/nav/overlayAccountBadge.tsx` (the mark on the
account control, the monogram here). Each ships inert; `src/overlaySeams.test.ts`
lists every seam and checks it is reached by its `@/…` specifier.

## Icons

Icons come from `react-icons/fi`, the library the sidebar and the nav registry
already use, and not from an inline `<svg>`: a hand-rolled glyph drifts from the
library icon it imitates, and at the sizes these ship (12px to 20px) the drift
is invisible until somebody looks closely. Inline SVG stays for the things that
are not icons, the product mark and a chart's own marks.

## Data and generated files

TanStack Query owns server state. Query keys, mutation invalidation, pagination,
and loading behavior follow the frontend standards topic guides.

Import API shapes from `@/client`, not directly from the generated schema.
`src/client/schema.ts` is generated from `docs/public/openapi.json` and
committed. Keep `src/client/local.ts` limited to shapes OpenAPI cannot own.

A field added to a gateway response model without a default lands in OpenAPI's
`required`, so it is non-optional in the regenerated client, and every
hand-written call site that builds that shape literally stops typechecking until
it carries the field. The generated file is where the diff stops, not where the
change stops, so a clean regeneration of a few added lines is not evidence that
the change is contained. `pnpm run lint` is Biome and does not typecheck, so
`pnpm run typecheck` is the gate that catches this; the usual call sites are the
builders in `src/tests/fixtures.ts` and the per-feature test files.

`apiFetch` in `shared/api/client.ts` prepends `API_ROOT` to every request. A
call site passes the resource only, `apiFetch("/keys")`, and never spells
`/api/v1`. A test that stubs `fetch` sees the whole URL; one that spies on
`apiFetch` sees the resource. The gateway's
`tests/integration/test_api_prefix_contract.py` fails on a doubled root
anywhere under `src/`.

File routes live in `src/routes/`. Each route file exports `Route` and
nothing else so automatic code splitting works. The generated
`src/routeTree.gen.ts` is committed.

Search parameters use the shared flat repeated-key codec and `useUrlState`.
Component tests for URL-aware pages use the real router helpers and await its
first resolution.

## Toolchain and build

Use pnpm as pinned in `package.json`. The Docker build stage is Node 26 and CI
tracks the `lts/*` alias, so `@types/node` follows the image at 26. Keep shared
React Aria dependencies on the version HeroUI resolves, and approve required
install scripts in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

The React Compiler runs through the configured Babel pass. Avoid reflexive
`useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`; effects still need correct
dependencies and cleanup.

`make dashboard` builds to `src/gateway/static/dashboard/`. The bundle is
gitignored and not committed. Docker builds it. A source checkout without it
serves the welcome page.

Two build inputs are committed when changed:

- `web/src/client/schema.ts`
- `web/src/routeTree.gen.ts`

`storybook-static/` is the third generated directory and is **not** committed,
like the dashboard bundle: `.github/workflows/otari-design-system.yml` builds it
and publishes it to Pages from `main`. `STORYBOOK_BASE_PATH` is what makes the
published build resolve its assets under `/<repo>/`, since the merged
`vite.config.ts` carries the app's own `base: "/"`.

The bundled dashboard guide imports `docs/dashboard.md`. It remains available
at `/#/docs` even when `docs_url` points the visible links elsewhere.

The PWA manifest is generated at build time by `web/pwaManifest.ts`, which
prefixes `id`, `start_url`, `scope`, and each icon path with Vite's resolved
`base` and rewrites the `index.html` link (#857). Do not add a static manifest
to `public/pwa/`; only the icons live there. The plugin is a standalone module
so the otari-ai superset build imports it rather than copying it.

Regenerate the icons with `pnpm --dir web run icons:generate`
(`web/scripts/generate-pwa-icons.mjs`). It rasterizes the mark through
Playwright's own Chromium rather than adding an image-processing dependency,
reads the target sizes from the manifest, and centers the mark by its 273x250
aspect so it is never stretched.

## Checks

```bash
pnpm --dir web run lint
pnpm --dir web run typecheck
pnpm --dir web test
pnpm --dir web run build
```

**`nav[aria-label="Sidebar"]` is not the whole rail.** The scope band above it
(the workspace switcher, the back row) and the footer below it (the Organization
switch, the account control) are siblings of the landmark inside the `<aside>`,
not children of it. A query scoped to the landmark misses them while they sit
visibly in the rail, and the failure reads as the element not rendering rather
than as the query looking in the wrong place. Query the page for anything in the
band or the footer.

**After resolving a conflict, go looking by name for every fix that landed in
that file since the merge base.** A conflict resolution reverts a review fix more
easily than anything else in the file: it is typically one line, it has no test
behind it, and it lives in a state no test reaches, while whoever is resolving is
holding the structural change in their head. Re-reading the diff does not catch
it, because an absent line has no shape. Grep the resolved file for the guard, the
flag or the narrowing you know should be there, and then re-run whatever
established it in the first place.

**A CI green and a local green answer different questions.** CI builds the pull
request's merge ref, so its run is the branch merged into `main` as it stood when
the run was created; a local run is the branch alone. The suites are therefore
different sets, CI's result can move with no change on the branch, and a test can
fail there against a combination nobody has run here. Before reading a CI green as
a statement about what you wrote, `git fetch origin main` and count
`HEAD..origin/main`: that is how far the tested thing is from the written thing.

Playwright behavioral tests run against a real built gateway and scope
assertions to the rows they create. Dismiss React Aria popovers before asserting
outside them.

**A failure's accessibility snapshot describes the state at capture, not at the
action.** It is written when the assertion finally times out, which can be
seconds after the click that actually failed, so it shows the page as it settled
rather than as it was pressed. Reading correctly-loaded content in one and
concluding a race is refuted is a mistake this repo has already made: the
snapshot has no bearing on what was on screen when the action ran. Use the trace
instead, where each action carries its own duration and error, and a click that
completed in 68ms with no error tells you the press was delivered and the app
dropped it.

Assertions that press a row therefore wait on the data before pressing, not just
on the element. A press delivered while a filtered query is in flight is
discarded by the re-render while Playwright's actionability check passes
happily, because the row it is about to press is present and visible right up to
the moment it is replaced.

Screenshot tests cover three viewports and both themes. They are
workflow-dispatch only, their baselines are gitignored, and CI artifacts are the
review output until the suite becomes a pull-request gate.

## Measuring the running dashboard

Ways a probe reports a real number that answers the wrong question. Each has
produced a wrong finding here more than once, and none of them errors. Left
uncounted deliberately: the sentence said "three" while eight followed it,
because a total in the prose has to be edited by every later addition and was
not.

**Check which bundle the tab is on first.** A gateway serves the last bundle
built into `src/gateway/static/dashboard/`, and a browser tab holds the one it
loaded, so a measurement can describe a build from an hour ago while the source
on disk says otherwise. Vite content-hashes every asset filename, which makes
the check cheap: build, note the emitted `assets/index-*.css`, and confirm the
tab is on that filename before trusting anything read from it.

**A computed style read in a background tab is frozen, not current.** While a
tab is not being rendered, `getComputedStyle` returns the start value of any
transition already running on the property and keeps returning it, so a scripted
state change reads back as the old color and a scripted press reads as no
transform at all. It looks like broken CSS rather than a sleeping instrument.
Suppress transitions before measuring anything that transitions
(`*{transition:none !important}` in an injected `<style>`, removed afterwards).
The same throttling stops `requestAnimationFrame` from firing, so a probe that
awaits a frame hangs instead of returning.

**A control's own box does not tell you whether it is visible.** The checkboxes
are drawn by a styled element beside a real `<input>` that react-aria hides, and
the hiding is on the input's wrapper. The input itself reports `opacity: 1`,
`position: static` and a 13x13 box, so a probe that measures inputs concludes
the product ships bare native checkboxes below the touch floor. It has concluded
that three times. Hit-test the element's own center with
`document.elementFromPoint`, or walk its `offsetParent` chain for a clipping
ancestor, before reporting geometry.

**The screenshot suite does not reach below the fold.** Its captures pass
`fullPage: true`, but the shell scrolls its content in an inner container rather
than scrolling the document, so a capture comes back at the viewport size
(1280x800 for the desktop projects) and anything further down the page is not in
it. The docs page is the clearest case: its one code fence sits below the fold
and appears in no screenshot project. Do not read a page's presence in that
suite as coverage of the whole page.

**Read the reporter, not the exit code, when a command is in a pipeline.** A
run piped into `tail`, `grep` or `head` exits with that stage's status, so a
suite with failures reports success and a green shell says nothing about the
tests. The same shape as the traps above from the other direction: those were
queries whose empty result read as a clean answer, this is a pipeline whose
last stage reported one. Check the failure count in the output, or keep the
command unpiped.

**A typecheck means nothing while any file has conflict markers.** One file
containing `<<<<<<<` suppresses every semantic diagnostic in the program, so
`tsc` reports only syntax errors and a clean-looking run mid-rebase proves
nothing. Reproduced on a two-file project: a real `TS2322` is reported alone and
disappears entirely once one unresolved file is added. Resolve the last conflict
before believing a typecheck, and treat lint and per-file test runs as the only
checks that hold before that.

**A bare `tsc --noEmit` checks nothing.** The root `tsconfig.json` is
`{"files": [], "references": [...]}`, so invoking `tsc` without `-b` resolves a
config that owns no files and exits clean over a tree the real typecheck rejects,
test files included. Use the command in Checks above. The tell that found this:
an `@ts-expect-error` whose error had been deliberately removed still reported
success, where `pnpm --dir web run typecheck` reports `TS2578`.

**Two instances of one control measuring differently is a sizing bug, not a
measurement.** Each is following the length of the prose beside it, so a control
sized by its neighbor's wording was never sized. The rule that prevents it is
`design/layout.md`, "Repeated rows": a trailing action takes `shrink-0` in any
flex row.

**Read the table's own block in `globals.css` before measuring anything.** Ten of
the sixteen per-table classes declare widths on some of their columns, keyed on
`data-key`, and `.otari-keys-table` is `table-layout: fixed` outright
(`globals.css:2731`, "Key lanes stay fixed while the name absorbs the available
width"). So a width is often written down rather than solved, and measuring the
live table to rediscover it is the slower route to a worse answer. Read both
blocks before changing one: `.otari-breakdown`'s columns are specified in two
places, as `min-width` at `globals.css:2279` and as `width` at `globals.css:2827`,
550 lines apart, and neither mentions the other.

What is still true is the part that made the advice worth having. A table is
`table-layout: auto` unless its block says otherwise, with 16px cell padding, so
**the columns nothing specifies are re-solved from content on every render** and
"take the width from column X" is a guess for those. Measure a change to one of
them by injecting the new cell into the live table and reading the result back.

- Give every part of an injected cell `flex: 0 0 auto`. Without it the parts
  shrink to fit and overflow their own element with no error, leaving column
  widths that look plausible and are not.
- Overwrite `last_used` with a real timestamp first. Every row in the seed says
  "never", and that one substitution moves a measured overflow from 0 to 23px.

**A dialog's bounding box is a few percent large while it opens.** The overlay
animates in on a scale transform, so `getBoundingClientRect()` read right after
the frame becomes visible returns the box mid-animation: a 928px dialog measured
963, and its container measured 1336 on a 1280 viewport, both the same 1.0438
factor. It reads as a width rule that lost a cascade fight, which is the thing
anyone measuring a dialog is usually there to check. `getComputedStyle(el).width`
is unaffected by the transform and is the number a width assertion wants;
`e2e/dashboard.spec.ts`'s share frame is the worked example. The background-tab
entry above is the same instrument failing from the other direction.

**And absence from the built CSS proves nothing on its own.** Tailwind emits
only the utilities something in the tree asks for, so checking whether a
`@utility` or a token survived the build needs a consumer inside `src` that
references it. A consumer written outside the scanned tree produces an empty
result that looks exactly like a rule that failed to compile.
