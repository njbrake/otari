// The shapes the OpenAPI spec does not describe, and why each one is here.
//
// Everything else the dashboard sends or receives comes from `./schema.ts`,
// generated from the gateway's spec. This file is the exception list, kept short
// and justified on purpose: a type that could come from the spec and does not is
// a type that will drift from the API without anyone noticing.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Routing policy bodies.
//
// `PolicyRequest.spec` and `PolicyResponse.spec` are declared as free-form
// objects on the wire, so the generator can only emit `Record<string, unknown>`
// for them, and the Routing page reads and writes their internals.
//
// The gateway does have a real `PolicySpec` model and the route already
// validates every write into it, so the wire contract is narrower than it says.
// Two things stop this PR from just publishing that model:
//
//   * On the request, the route hand-rolls a 400 that names the offending field
//     so the policy form can bind each error to its input. Annotating the body
//     as `PolicySpec` would hand that to FastAPI's generic 422 and lose it.
//   * On the response, `PolicySpec` carries defaults, so serializing through it
//     would add `spec_version`, `guardrails: []` and six null keys per select
//     entry to every policy. Suppressing that means a serializer on `PolicySpec`
//     itself, which is also what the two write paths dump before storing, so it
//     would change what is written to the database, not just what is read back.
//
// Both are fixable and worth fixing; neither belongs in the same change as the
// client generation. Until then these stay hand-written and can drift, which is
// the cost being accepted here.
