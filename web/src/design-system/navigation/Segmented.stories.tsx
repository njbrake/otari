/**
 * A closed choice of four or fewer, in a track.
 *
 * The line against `FilterSelect` is the option count: at four or fewer, a
 * track shows every alternative without a click and costs less than a popover.
 * Past four it stops fitting a toolbar and `FilterSelect` takes over.
 *
 * The line against `TabRow`: tabs switch which *view* is on screen, a segmented
 * control changes a *parameter* of the view that is already there. A page can
 * have both, and the usage page does.
