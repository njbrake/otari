/**
 * A settings row that opens in place, for detail belonging to the row rather
 * than beside it.
 *
 * **The whole row is the button**, which is what keeps the target at the row's
 * own size: a chevron is a 16px glyph, and making it the control would put a
 * 16px target in a 44px row. No press transform either, unlike an action
 * button: a row is a surface, and a surface that shrinks under the finger reads
 * as a misfire.
 *
 * Controlled, so the page decides what is open. It renders as **two** children
 * of a `SettingsGroup` rather than one, so the group's own divider draws the
 * line between the row and the panel it opened.
 *
 * The panel is always in the DOM and toggles `hidden`, so `aria-controls`
 * always names an element that exists.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `navigation/Disclosure`, which is a standalone
 * heading that opens; this one is a settings row.
