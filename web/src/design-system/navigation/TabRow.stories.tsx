/**
 * A row of views over the same data, and the lane they sit in.
 *
 * Documented as a pair because neither is useful alone: `TabRow` owns the lane
 * and its rule, `Tab` owns one item. They ship from one module for the same
 * reason `RowAction` ships with `RowActionRow`.
 *
 * Controlled, and the active tab is the caller's state. On a real page that
 * state usually lives in the URL through `useUrlState`, so a reload keeps the
 * view; a `Tab` that tracked its own selection would put it out of reach.
