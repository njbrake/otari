/**
 * One choice out of a small closed set, as a bounded segmented control.
 *
 * A tab row and this are the same shape doing different jobs, which is why
 * they are two components: a tab CHANGES WHAT YOU SEE and is unbounded, while
 * a segment RECORDS A CHOICE the form will submit and is bounded, because the
 * track is what says "these are the alternatives and there are no others".
 *
 * It exists because the alternative was worse in a specific way. Rendering the
 * options as buttons and filling the chosen one primary puts the CTA's own
 * treatment on a value: it reads as an action to take rather than an option
 * chosen, and it sat beside a real submit button wearing exactly the same
 * fill.
 *
 * The selected segment is a surface step and foreground ink rather than a
 * fill, for the reason the whole surface is: a fill here would be the only
 * filled thing in a form that has none.
 *
 * Native radios rather than buttons with `role="radio"`: the semantics are
 * exactly a radio group's, and taking the real element brings the arrow-key
 * navigation and the one-tab-stop-per-group behavior with it instead of
 * reimplementing them. Each input is visually hidden and its label is the
 * segment, so the focus ring has to be drawn on the label.
