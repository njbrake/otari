 * open so one opening's state cannot survive into the next.
 *
 * It shares `FormDialog`'s geometry class family in `design-system.css`, which is why
 * both sit at the same height, cap at the same viewport budget and become the
 * same full-screen sheet on a phone. A second set of numbers under a second
 * prefix would be one edit away from two dialogs that no longer match.
