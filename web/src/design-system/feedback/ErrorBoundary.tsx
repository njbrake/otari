/**
 * The catch above the router, and the only one the pre-session pages have.
 *
 * Everything inside `RouterProvider` is already caught, so this covers only
 * `App`'s four branches above it: the sign-in screen, the public auth pages,
 * the invitation page, and the hybrid landing page. A throw in one of those
 * unmounts to a blank document with nothing in it but a console line, which is
 * the worst place in the app to lose, because the sign-in screen is the only
 * page an operator can reach before every other one (otari#806).
 * `router.test.tsx` has which boundary answers where.
 *
 * A class because React offers no hook for this; `getDerivedStateFromError` and
 * `componentDidCatch` are still the only way to catch a render.
 *
 * Nothing is logged here on purpose: `src/` writes to no console anywhere, and
 * the error is on screen, which is the whole point of the panel.
