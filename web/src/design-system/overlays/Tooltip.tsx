 * reads as having no labels at all. A third of a second answers without
 * flashing a label at every glyph a pointer crosses on the way past. A prop
 * rather than an override of that variable, so the behavior travels with the
 * component rather than with the app's stylesheet; react-aria still opens the
 * next tooltip in a group instantly once one has been seen.

/**
 * A short label revealed by hovering or focusing the thing it describes.
 *
 * **A tooltip is never the only channel.** motion-and-access.md's rule about
 * hover applies hardest here: a tooltip does not exist on a phone, so anything
 * only it says is unsaid for a touch operator. That makes it right for a
 * *repetition* (spelling out an icon-only control that already has an
 * `aria-label`, giving an exact timestamp beside a relative one) and wrong for
 * anything an operator needs in order to act.
 *
 * Two shapes, and which one you want depends on whether the thing described is
 * itself a control:
 *
 * - **A node**, for content that is not interactive. It is wrapped in HeroUI's
 *   own trigger, which is a `div` the library gives `role="button"` and
 *   `tabIndex=0` so a keyboard can reach it at all.
 * - **A function**, for a native control. It receives the trigger's props and
 *   must spread every one of them onto its own element, the `ref` included. The
 *   wrapper's `role="button"` around a real button is the reason this form
 *   exists: it would announce "Edit button" inside "Edit button", take a tab
 *   stop of its own, and give every `getByRole("button")` two matches instead
 *   of one, which is a dozen assertions in this repo's e2e suite.
 *
 * A HeroUI `Button` (so `IconButton`) cannot use the function form and keeps the
 * wrapper: its props are react-aria's rather than the DOM's, so the trigger's
 * `onClick` and `onPointerEnter` do not even typecheck against it. That is why
 * the props are typed for a `button` here rather than generically.
 *
 * Either way the trigger keeps its own type, which is what a `trigger={<Button/>}`
 * prop could not have done: the tooltip would have been the parent of a node it
 * cannot type-check.
