// An identifier the operator needs verbatim (a model id, an alias target, a
// request id), rendered so it can be taken either way: highlighted with the mouse
// like ordinary text, or copied in one press.
//
// Highlighting is what needs the help. Inside a react-aria table the row is a
// press target, and a press on it both toggles the row's selection and sets
// `user-select: none` on the row for the duration; the re-render that selection
// causes lands mid-drag and discards the selection the browser had started, so
// dragging across an id would otherwise select nothing at all (issue #478). Keeping the
// press from starting on the value itself is the fix: the pointer sequence stays
// with the browser, which selects text with it. `select-text` then beats the
// inherited `none` from any press elsewhere in the row (an own declaration
// outranks inheritance, so no `!important` is needed). The rest of the row keeps
// its behavior: DataTable still opens a drill-in for a plain click, including one
// on this value, and skips it for the click that ends a drag.
