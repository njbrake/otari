// A compact copy control for an identifier an operator has to paste elsewhere (a
// model id, an alias target). Table rows own click-drag for selection, so the
// text in a cell cannot be highlighted by hand (issue #478); this is how it gets
// out. copyToClipboard covers the plain-HTTP origins this dashboard is routinely
// served from, where the async Clipboard API does not exist; if even the legacy
// path fails, this says so rather than claiming a copy it did not make (the same
// rule as the Keys page's CopyField). Unlike that one, the value here is not a
// form field this can select for the operator, so the failure message asks them
// to select it rather than implying something already is.
// The acknowledgement is a tooltip over the icon that was pressed, so the answer
// appears where the operator is looking in a column of identical buttons. It is
// controlled (never hover-opened) because it reports an event, not a hint, and it
// renders in an overlay so it is not clipped by the table's scroll container and
// does not reflow the row it reports on.
