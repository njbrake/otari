/**
 * A verbatim block to be read and taken: a label row on the code surface, and
 * the code itself under it.
 *
 * The one place in this product where an edge is right. Everything else is
 * divided by a hairline on the page's own ground, but a code block is a small
 * object sitting on that ground rather than a division of it: it is a thing to
 * be copied whole, and the border is what says where it ends.
 *
 * The copy affordance is a cell of the label row rather than a button floating
 * over the code, which is how the copy family behaves everywhere else here and
 * is also what keeps it off the first line of the snippet.
 *
 * `value` is the exact text a copy yields, which is not always what is
 * rendered: the bundled guide hands this the raw fence while `children` carries
 * react-markdown's own nodes. With no `value` there is nothing to copy and the
 * control is absent rather than dead.
 *
 * With no `label`, the row reads "code" and the block is named "Code": an
 * unlabeled row would be a bar with a control and no subject, and "code" is the
 * honest name for a block whose author did not say what it is.
 *
 * `arrangement` picks between the two shapes. `labeled` is the prose default
 * above. `bare` drops the row entirely and floats the copy control on the code
 * itself, for a block whose subject is already named beside it: the setup
 * sheet's tab row says which language this is, so a label row under it would
 * say it twice and cost a band of the frame to do it.
