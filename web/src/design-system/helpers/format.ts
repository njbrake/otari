 * The display formatters the components here need, and nothing else.

 * live here because components in this layer need them and cannot import that
 * one: `TrendChip` and `RefreshButton` for the percentage and the relative
 * time, `TablePagination` and `BulkActionBar` for the grouped count. The rest
 * of that module (`formatUsd`, `formatTokens`, `formatCost`, `formatContext`)
 * stays there, because a spend figure and a token count are this product's
 * vocabulary where a grouped integer is not.
 *
 * There is one implementation of each: `@/shared/helpers/format` re-exports
 * these under the names it already published, so no call site moved and there
 * is no second copy to drift.
