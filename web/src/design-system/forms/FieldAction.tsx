/**
 * A child of a control row that has no caption of its own, aligned to the
 * input line: a trailing action, or any mid-row control without one.
 *
 * A row of controls is laid out `items-end`, which bottom-aligns each child's
 * whole box. A field's box includes the caption line it reserves under its
 * input, so a bare button beside it lands level with the caption rather than
 * with the input it acts on. This gives the action the same trailing reserve
 * the fields have, which puts the two input lines on the same row.
 *
 * It reserves rather than nudging: no `self-*`, no padding, and nothing that
 * asks `align-items` for what it cannot do. The height is the caption role's
 * own line height, so a retune of the caption carries the action with it.
 *
 * Two limits, both real. Every field in these rows must reserve exactly one
 * caption line: a message long enough to wrap makes that one field taller and
 * drops it back out of line, and no reserve here can answer that.
 *
 * And these rows are `flex-wrap`, where `items-end` aligns each flex LINE to its
 * own cross-end rather than the row as a whole. So this aligns the action within
 * whatever line it lands on, which after a wrap may hold nothing else. Correct
 * per line, not per row.
