/**
 * The line under a field, and the space it takes whether or not it speaks.
 *
 * A field's description and its error are **one role at one size, separated by
 * color**, so they occupy one line and share one reserve. An error therefore
 * *replaces* the description rather than adding a row, which is what keeps a
 * form from growing as it is validated.
 *
 * `ControlField` is the same label-and-description rig for a control that is not
 * a HeroUI field: a segmented group, a multi-select, a scope picker. It exists
 * because that construct was hand-written each time as a `text-sm` label over a
 * `text-xs` description, which is how the size drifted below the caption in
 * eight files at once.
