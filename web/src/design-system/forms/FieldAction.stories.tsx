/**
 * A child of a control row with no caption of its own, aligned to the input
 * line.
 *
 * The problem it solves is only visible as a comparison, which is what the
 * first story is. A control row is laid out `items-end`, and that bottom-aligns
 * each child's whole box. A field's box includes the caption line it reserves,
 * so a bare button beside it lands level with the *caption* rather than with
 * the input it acts on. Wrapping the button gives it the same reserve, which
 * puts the two input lines on one row.
 *
 * It reserves rather than nudging: no `self-*`, no padding, nothing asking
 * `align-items` for what it cannot do. The height is the caption role's own
 * line height, so retuning the caption carries the action with it.
