/**
 * One of a set, searchable, in a form the operator submits.
 *
 * The combo box counterpart to `forms/Select`, and the prop vocabulary is
 * deliberately Select's wherever the two mean the same thing: an operator of
 * this codebase reads the "Signatures" table in `web/design/forms.md` as one
 * vocabulary, and a control that spelled `onChange` or `errorMessage`
 * differently would cost them that. A combo box is not a longer select, so
 * three things are its own: free text may be allowed, the list opens on typing
 * or on focus, and the list can legitimately be empty.
 *
 * That last one is why this exists rather than each page building its own. A
 * combo box keeps its menu open on an empty collection, so that a query
 * matching nothing does not read as a field that broke; the cost is a popover
 * with nothing in it, which reads as a field that broke for a different reason.
 * `ComboBoxEmpty` is the sentence that tells those apart, and there is no way
 * to render this control without one.
 *
 * `value` is an option's `value`, as in `forms/Select`, and never a label. An
 * id and a name point at the same thing, so identity travels as the id,
 * through react-aria's `selectedKey`, and the label is only displayed: this
 * field owns the input's text and shows the matched option's label. Picking a
 * row reports its id, once. With `allowsCustomValue` the text an operator
 * types is reported as the value too, because a list that is a shortcut rather
 * than a whitelist has to let something it never offered stand; that text is
 * then itself rather than a lookup, since a label maps back to no single id
 * (two rows may share one, and one row's label may be another row's id).
 *
 * No filtering of its own: `options` is what the popover holds, and
 * `onQueryChange` is what the caller matches on. The caller matches and caps,
 * because what counts as a match differs per field (an id as well as a name, a
 * ceiling with a "showing N of M" line under it).
