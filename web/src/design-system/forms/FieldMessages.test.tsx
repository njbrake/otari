/**
 * The line under a field, and the two things about it that a reader cannot see.
 *
 * The first is which element wears the type role. The docstring spends a
 * paragraph on it because getting it wrong compiles and ships: HeroUI merges a
 * className through tailwind-merge, which cannot tell a custom `text-caption`
 * from a text color, so a role and a color on the same element lose the role and
 * keep the color. The role therefore belongs on the wrapper and the child gets
 * nothing but its ink, and neither half of that is visible in a rendered tree
 * until somebody measures the text.
 *
 * The second is the reserve. It exists to stop a form jumping when a message
 * appears, so its failure mode is motion on somebody else's screen rather than
 * anything a test would notice, and it is expressed as the role's own
 * line-height variable rather than a pixel so a retune of the caption carries
 * the reserve with it.
 *
 * What jsdom can and cannot say here: it does no layout, so the reserve is
 * asserted as the class that carries it rather than as a measured height, the
 * same limit every size assertion in this suite works under.
