 * two components rather than one with a `context` prop. A filter's label is a
 * caption beside the control and it never speaks a validation message; a form
 * field's label sits above it, is always visible, and owns a description and an
 * error line that has to be announced on the control. Those are different
 * components wearing the same trigger, and the prop list that served both would
 * be mostly ignored at each call site.
 *
 * On HeroUI's `Select` rather than a native `<select>` for the reason
 * `FilterSelect` gives: a native menu draws itself *over* the control on macOS,
 * covering the trigger that opened it.
