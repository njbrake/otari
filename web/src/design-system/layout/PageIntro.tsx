/**
 * A page's opening: its title, the paragraph under it, and the one action that
 * belongs beside rather than below them.
 *
 * Shared so the type of a page title is decided once rather than respelled on
 * every page. The title is `text-display`, the scale's 28/34 semibold step; the
 * weight axis has only 550 and 600, so an arbitrary utility asking for 600
 * lands on 550 instead. Do not quote an arbitrary size spelling anywhere in
 * this file, comments included: `foundation.test.ts` matches that spelling
 * against raw file contents without stripping comments first, so a quoted
 * example keeps the file on the offender list with nothing wrong to find.
 *
 * `pb-5` rather than a gap on the parent, because a page is a stack of bands
 * that set their own rules and spacing, and a column gap would add air above
 * the first rule as well.
