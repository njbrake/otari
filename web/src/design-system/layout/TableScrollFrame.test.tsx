/**
 * The cue that appears with the state and leaves with it.
 *
 * A table at rest has no internal verticals, so the pinned lane's boundary is
 * drawn only while the table is scrolled off its left edge, and everything
 * downstream of that is a CSS rule keyed on `data-scrolled`. Which means the
 * attribute is the whole contract: if it is missing, stale, or never flips, the
 * boundary is simply always there or never there and nothing throws.
 *
 * The listener has to go on `.table__scroll-container`, which is HeroUI's
 * element and not something a call site can reach, so these tests stand in a
 * div with that class rather than mounting a real table.
 *
 * `fixture-frame` stands for whatever class a page hands down. It is local on
 * purpose: a primitive's test borrowing a feature's class would read as a
 * dependency the layer rules forbid, and would go looking for a rename that has
 * nothing to do with it.
