 * Shared so the rank of a group is decided once: spelled by hand, groups of the
 * same rank on the same page drift to different heading sizes.
 *
 * Two bands rather than one, which is what puts the heading *between* rules
 * rather than above them: the first carries the rule over the heading, the
 * second the rule under it and the rule closing the last row.
 *
 * `bounded` is the other shape: the heading sits unruled above a framed block
 * of rows, inside the page column rather than bleeding to the scroll area's
 * edges. It reads as one object on a page that stacks several small groups,
 * where the full-width bands run together into a single striped field.
