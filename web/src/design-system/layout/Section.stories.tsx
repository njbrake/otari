/**
 * A band of the page: rules that run the full width of the scroll area, with
 * the content inside them still in the centered column.
 *
 * Two elements, because one cannot be both full-width and centered.
 *
 * **Every story here passes `bleed={false}`**, and that is the interesting part
 * rather than a workaround. The escape is `100cqw` measured against `<main>`,
 * so a bleeding band needs the app's scroll container to escape *to*; in a story
 * canvas there is none, and a bleeding band would overflow the frame instead of
 * stopping at a column. It is the same reason a band nested inside a narrow cell
 * has to say `bleed={false}` in the real app.
