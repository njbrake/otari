 * A band of the page: rules that run the full width of the scroll area, with
 * the content inside them still in the centered column.
 *
 * It takes two elements, because one element cannot be both full-width and
 * centered. `.otari-bleed` escapes `<main>` (see design-system.css for why it is
 * container units and not `100vw`); the inner element restores the column.
 *
 * `className` styles the band: its rules, its vertical padding, its own layout
 * if the content is a single row. `contentClassName` styles the column inside.
 *
 * `bleed={false}` for a band nested inside a column rather than sitting
 * directly in the scroll area. The escape is `100cqw` against `<main>`, so a
 * bleeding band nested in a narrow cell overflows the page instead of stopping
 * at its column. A nested band rules its own container and aligns to its edges.
