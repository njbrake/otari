 *
 * Exported so a loading frame standing in for a row takes the same width, which
 * is what keeps settings arriving from moving the page.
 *
 * 17.5rem is what the widest cluster on a settings page needs, a field beside
 * its own button, so widening the narrow controls to the lane is what changed
 * rather than narrowing the wide ones. It steps down at `md`, where the shell
 * still draws its 16.5rem sidebar beside a full-bleed row: a lane that wide
 * there leaves a label like "Intercept provider web search" about 120px to wrap
 * in. Both steps are one width across the whole group, so the column's edges are
 * straight at either.

/**
 * What a setting is on the left, the control that changes it on the right.
 *
 * Shared because a settings page is almost entirely this shape, and spelled by
 * hand the label size, the key caption and the control lane drift between
 * groups on the same page. The row draws no rules of its own: `SettingsGroup`
 * divides its children, and a border here would give every seam two lines.
 *
 * **The lane is one width down the page and the control fills it**, which is
 * the fixed-width-slot rule `design/layout.md` states for any repeated row.
 * Sized per control it was not a lane at all: a URL field, a select and a
 * two-digit number came out 220px, 174px and 88px, so the column had a
 * different left edge on every row. A field takes `w-full` (or `min-w-0 flex-1`
 * beside a trailing button), a `FilterSelect` takes `fullWidth`, and a number
 * keeps `text-right tabular-nums` so its digits still read against the lane's
 * edge.
 *
 * Only an error may add a line to a row, which is what keeps the help text from
 * rewrapping under the cursor while a value is being changed.
