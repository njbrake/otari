/**
 * What a setting is on the left, the control that changes it on the right.
 *
 * Shared because a settings page is almost entirely this shape, and spelled by
 * hand the label size, the key caption and the control lane drift between
 * groups on the same page.
 *
 * **The row draws no rules of its own.** `SettingsGroup` divides its children,
 * so a border here would give every seam two lines. That is why the stories
 * below put it inside a group rather than showing it bare.
 *
 * **The lane is one width down the page and the control fills it.** Sized per
 * control it was not a lane at all, which `SharedLane` below is about.
 *
 * Below `md` the control stops sharing the row and stacks full width under the
 * label, which is also where the label becomes a press target worth having, and
 * why `controlId` exists.
 *
 * Every story passes `bounded`, because every real caller does: that is what
 * puts the rows inside `.otari-settings`, the dense place whose controls are
 * 32px beside their label on a desk and 44px at 16px where they stack on a
 * phone. Without it a row renders at the form height and the story would be
 * showing a size the page never uses.
