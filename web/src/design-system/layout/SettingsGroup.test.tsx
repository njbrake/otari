 * The two rule tiers, pinned.

 * A section rule divides the page and a row separator divides repeated things
 * inside one section, and the two are different weights on purpose. Using the
 * section tier for both flattens the hierarchy into a single weight, which is
 * what a hand-rolled list drifts into. Every settings list in the app is this
 * component and none of them names a tier, so the mistake is only reachable
 * from here.
