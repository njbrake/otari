    // stayed put (measured with a 1180px column: value tops 241 against 223).
    // Subgridding the cell's four parts onto the strip's own rows lines the
    // labels, values, deltas and graphics up with their neighbors instead, and
    // reserves nothing when no label wraps, so it costs no dead space wide.

    // baseline as the last line of a two-line one.

    // itself by default. The strip's tracks are already `minmax(0,1fr)`, so the
    // cell's box is its track; what was unbounded was the column INSIDE it,
    // which took its floor from the widest child. The subline never wraps, so
    // its min-content is the whole string: measured with a 59-character
    // subline, the inner column came out 356px inside a 283px cell and every
    // child sized to it, the sparkline included, painted 129px into the cell
    // beside it (218px at 1280, since the track shrinks and the string does
    // not). Bounding the column is what makes the truncation and the
    // sparkline's `w-full` mean anything.
