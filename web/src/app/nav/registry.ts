/**
 * The organization context: what belongs to the tenant rather than to one
 * workspace inside it.
 *
 * Reached from the sidebar footer and left by the "Back to" link at its top,
 * so the two contexts never render together. Gated on the caller managing the
 * organization, which in a standalone deployment is always true: there is one
 * session, the local operator, and it owns the organization the gateway
 * provisioned for itself. The gate is written anyway because it is the thing
 * that becomes load-bearing the moment per-user sign-in lands (otari-ai#1716).
 *
 * One of the design's rows is **declared and gated on a surface the standalone
 * bootstrap does not report** (`STANDALONE_SURFACES` in
 * `src/gateway/api/routes/bootstrap.py` is that list), so it is absent here and
 * present on a deployment that serves it, and a group whose every row is gated
 * drops entirely, heading included. Usage is that row; its own comment says why.
 *
 * The organization's guardrails are not such a row: `organization_guardrails`
 * is published by both topologies, because its rows are keyed on the
 * organization. It is in General, under Deployment providers. Gateway holds
 * nothing in this build and drops; it stays declared for an overlay's Gateways.
 *
 * The organization's own provider credentials are not such a row either:
 * `organization_providers` is published by both topologies, because the page
 * behind it is where an organization's models are offered, priced and switched.
 * It sits under General beside the process-global `providers` row, under a
 * different label; see that pair for why.
 *
 * The design draws two more, Billing and Gateways, and neither is declared here
 * at all, because neither is this build's to declare: Billing is
 * ARCHITECTURE.md's canonical overlay-only capability, and the attached-gateway
 * surface behind Gateways is hosted depth (otari-ai#1779), so an overlay owns
 * both rows together with the pages under them and contributes them through
 * `overlayNavItems.ts`. Declaring either here would be worse than redundant: a
 * base route file at a path the overlay also serves is not shadowed by the
 * overlay's, it collides with it. The generator refuses the pair ("Conflicting
 * configuration paths were found") instead of choosing between them, so the
 * composed tree is never written: the Vite plugin logs that error and keeps
 * building against the tree already on disk, where the overlay's page has no
 * route at all, and a step that generates the tree on its own fails outright.
 *
 * The surface axis rather than the capability one, and that is a constraint
 * rather than a preference: `registry.test.ts` requires every capability a base
 * entry names to be in `BASE_CAPABILITIES`, that is, to be granted, so a
 * capability gate cannot express "declared but not served" without relaxing that
 * invariant. A surface gate says exactly this and needs no test change.
