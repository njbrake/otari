/**
 * The seam as a build that replaces the module sees it, which is the one thing
 * `registry.test.ts` cannot show: the list is empty there, so its assertions
 * hold whether or not the registry applies the contributions at all. Unwiring
 * `composeNavItems` from any rail leaves that suite green and turns this file
 * red, which is the point of it, and the organization rail is the one that
 * matters most: Billing and Gateways are why the seam exists and both land
 * there.
 *
 * `to` borrows a base path on purpose. The real destinations are paths only the
 * composed build has a route for, and `NavPath` resolves against *this* build's
 * route tree; what is under test is where a contributed row lands, not where it
 * points.
