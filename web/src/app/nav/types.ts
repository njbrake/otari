   *
   * The third axis, and the only one about *who is calling* rather than about
   * the deployment: `surface` asks whether the process hosts the page and
   * `capability` whether the deployment is licensed for it, and both answer the
   * same for everyone signed in. Resolved through
   * `shared/api/hooks.useOrganizationContext`, whose `deployment_operator` field
   * is the server reporting the caller's own standing under the same predicate
   * `/admin` enforces, rather than a second rule that could disagree with it.
   *
   * **Neither value shows a row before the answer arrives.** A rail gate grants
   * nothing, so the cost of hiding a row too long is a row that appears late,
   * while the cost of showing one too early is a row that told someone a
   * destination was theirs and then took it back. `AppShell` states the
   * principle: a row that appears late is not a row that told anyone it was
   * missing. The axis used to be a query of its own, which put that answer
   * behind the first paint and made every non-operator watch most of the sidebar
   * render and vanish (#836); riding on the context the shell already reads is
   * what removed the window rather than picking a side in it.
   *
   * The two values are therefore not a preference either, and what separates
   * them is what a *failed* read means. A rail gate mirrors the server's
   * refusal, so it has to mirror *which* refusal:
   *
   * - `"unlisted"` for a destination the server answers **404** on, meaning it
   *   declines to admit the page exists (`/admin`). With no answer the rail
   *   must not reveal it either, so a failed read leaves the row absent.
   * - `"refused"` for a destination the server answers **403** on, which is
   *   every router gated on `require_deployment_operator`. Its existence is no
   *   secret, only its use is gated, and the pages behind these rows are the
   *   deployment's own. So a failed read shows the row, for the reason
   *   `AppShell` fails `managesOrganization` open: hiding seven destinations
   *   because one query failed strands them, and each says so itself when
   *   opened.
   *
   * A missing one is ungated. Client-side only, like the other two: the server
   * authorizes every request the page makes regardless. A page that is only
   * *partly* deployment-wide declares nothing here on purpose, since hiding a
   * destination a member does use costs more than a panel on it reporting its
   * own refusal.
