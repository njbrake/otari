/**
 * The one place a sidebar row's shape is decided.
 *
 * Every row in either rail goes through `navRowClass`: the leaves, a group's
 * expand trigger, the "Back to" link at the head of the organization rail, the
 * Organization row in the footer, and the collapsed icon buttons. Keeping them
 * in one module is what stops the rail drifting a row at a time, and it mirrors
 * `otari-ai/frontend/src/app/navigationRowStyles.ts` so the two shells stay
 * recognizably the same file at M5.
 *
 * Three decisions worth knowing before editing:
 *
 * **44px is the floor, everywhere.** `min-h-11` rather than vertical padding, so
 * a row with a longer label that wraps grows instead of squashing, and so a row
 * is a comfortable touch target on the mobile drawer without a second rule.
 *
 * **Hover and selection are steps off the rail.** Every
 * state is one or two steps along the neutral ramp from whatever the rail is.
 * Hover and selection deliberately move by different amounts rather than in the
 * same direction by different degrees, so they cannot read as one fill.
 *
 * | state            | light                   | dark                    |
 * | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
 * | resting          | no fill                 | no fill                 |
 * | hover            | `surface-alt`           | `surface-alt`           |
 * | focused          | no fill (the ring only) | no fill (the ring only) |
 * | pressed          | `background`            | `background`            |
 * | selected         | `surface-subtle` + edge | `surface-subtle` + edge |
 * | selected + hover | `surface-subtle` (none) | `surface-subtle` (none) |
 *
 * No `dark:` override is needed for any of them, because the surface family is
 * staggered one rung above the background family in both themes. Adding
 * `dark:bg-surface` here resolves to the rail's own value and erases the
 * selection.
 *
 * **The pressed fill currently does nothing, and that is a known open item
 * rather than an oversight here.** The shell is flat: the rail *is*
 * `--color-background`, so `active:bg-background` paints the rail's own value
 * and measures 0.00 L* from it in both themes, against +9.83/-5.18 for hover
 * and +6.77/-2.41 for selection. Press has nowhere below the ground to go, so
 * restoring it means picking a different direction, which is a design decision
 * and not one to make from inside this file. The classes stay so the state has
 * somewhere to land when that is decided.
 *
 * A selected row answers the pointer with neither hover nor press. It is the
 * current page, so clicking it is a no-op and there is nothing for an
 * affordance to promise. `ROW_RESTING` gives a hovered row
 * `hover:text-foreground` as well as a fill, so a selected row that also took
 * the hover fill would be indistinguishable from a hovered resting one, and
 * losing "is the row under my pointer the page I am on" costs more than losing
 * a hover response on a row that does nothing when clicked.
 *
 * **A nested child is indented with padding, not a narrower box.** `3.125rem`
 * clears the parent's icon lane (0.75rem padding + 1rem icon + 0.75rem gap) and
 * adds 0.625rem on top, which is what tells the eye the row is one level down,
 * and the row's fill still spans the rail. This is the one measurement where
 * `otari-ai/frontend`'s rail and the Paper design disagree: the design draws the
 * child's label in exactly its parent's lane (2.5rem). The sibling repo wins,
 * because these two rails are meant to be the same rail at M5.

/**
 * The keyboard ring, on every row whatever else it is wearing, which is why it
 * lives in the base and not in one of the state constants below.
 *
 * The ring itself is `otari-focus-ring`, defined once in the design system's
 * own stylesheet. Its values are
 * not spelled here and must not be: call sites that spell their own disagree
 * about which token a ring comes from. What is spelled here is why this row
 * cannot use the base rule instead.
 *
 * It is an outline and not the box-shadow ring HeroUI draws on its own
 * focusable components, for one reason: a shadow ring's offset is an opaque
 * band that has to be told the color of the ground behind it, and these rows
 * sit on two grounds (the rail, and `--color-surface` inside a collapsed
 * group's flyout). Any single offset color is wrong on one of them, while an
 * outline's offset is transparent and shows whatever is actually there. A
 * transparent offset band is not the way out of that: box-shadow layers
 * composite, so it would paint the ring's color rather than the ground.
 *
 * The two suppressions are for the rows that are HeroUI `Button`s, which draw
 * their own inner ring off `data-focus-visible`; without them it sits inside
 * this outline as a second mark. Both are in the components layer, so a utility
 * wins. `.button` also carries `outline-none` there, which is why the ring has
 * to arrive as a utility at all rather than from the base rule.

/**
 * `font-sans` is load-bearing, not decoration. A group's row is a
 * `Disclosure.Trigger` wrapped in a `Disclosure.Heading`, which HeroUI renders
 * as a real `<h3>`, and the base reset gives every `h1`-`h6` the display face.
 * The button inherits it, so without this the rows that hold sub-items (Routing,
 * Tools) come out in Mozilla Headline while their leaf siblings are in Mozilla
 * Text.
 * Naming the family on the shared row is what keeps the rail one typeface
 * wherever a row is rendered, rather than patching the one heading that has a
 * control inside it.
 *
 * Deliberately no `cursor-pointer`, and it is the one thing a call site is left
 * to name. Nearly every element this dresses already resolves to `pointer` on
 * its own: the leaves and the footer's desktop rows are `Link`s, so the
 * `<a href>` takes it from the user agent, and the expand triggers and the
 * account control carry HeroUI's `.disclosure__trigger` or `.button`, which set
 * `cursor: var(--cursor-interactive)`. The exceptions are the mobile drawer's
 * two bare `<button>`s, the row that opens the organization submenu and the row
 * that leaves it again, where the user agent gives a plain button the default
 * arrow; both add the utility themselves. It stays out of the base because here
 * it would also outrank `status-disabled`'s `--cursor-disabled` on the account
 * control, so a disabled row would promise a click.

// The 2px selection edge is reserved on every row here, and *colored* by the
// two state constants below: `border-transparent` on a resting row,
// `border-foreground` on the selected one. Reserving the width is what keeps
// the indent honest: a selected state that added `border-l-2` and subtracted
// 2px of left padding to compensate would collide with a nested row's own
// `pl-[3.125rem]` and drop a selected child back into its parent's lane. A
// border every row already carries cannot move anything.
//
// The color cannot live here alongside the width, and the trap is invisible in
// the source: `border-transparent` and
// `border-foreground` are both `border-color` utilities at equal specificity,
// so the class attribute's order decides nothing and Tailwind's emitted order
// does. It emits `border-transparent` last, so a row carrying both measured
// `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` on the page while reading as correct in the JSX. Exactly
// one border-color utility may reach a row.
// The horizontal padding is composed in `navRowClass` rather than set here, for
// the reason the border color above is: a row in a chrome band pads by 24px and
// a collapsed one by nothing, and three padding utilities on one row would leave
// which of them wins to Tailwind's emitted order.
