 * sits above both halves the axis gates, the navigation and the `<Outlet>` the
 * routes render into, which is what the seam is for. The base default renders
 * its children unchanged, so this build's shell is the shell it was.
 *
 * Here rather than in `__root.tsx` or beside `DeploymentProvider` in `App.tsx`,
 * because everything that reads the axis is inside the shell and because the
 * resolver a superset build swaps in issues a query: it belongs behind the auth
 * gate `App.tsx` puts the router behind, not in front of it. So the surfaces
 * that render instead of the shell (the sign-in screen, the public auth pages,
 * the hybrid landing) are deliberately outside it: none of them gates on a
 * capability, and a visitor without a session has nothing to resolve one from.
 *
 * `PostSignInGate` is the seam for anything that has to be shown once, in front
 * of the whole app, after a session exists (otari#789): a hosted signup's
 * profile questions, in the build that has a signup. It is mounted here rather

                context, since the organization one has its own way back, and
                only for someone who manages the organization: it is the single
                destination the design hides outright rather than degrading to
                read-only (artboard A2 is the member variant, and this row is
                what it drops).

                Drawn as an ordinary nav row, which is how the design draws it.
                It used to be a bordered box with a trailing chevron, on the
                argument that a context switch should not look like a page and
                that an operator whose sidebar used to list Users, Budgets and
                Settings needed to find where they went. Both were true and
                neither survives the design: the box makes the footer read as a
                button bar under the rail rather than as the end of it.

                Two controls for one entry, because the rail behaves differently
                under the two layouts. On the desk it navigates, and the rail it
                swaps to is left on screen to read. On a phone the drawer closes
                over whatever it navigated to, so the same tap would show the
                organization's first page and never the rail that lists the
                rest; there the row opens that rail inside the drawer instead,
                and a destination in it is what dismisses the drawer. That is
                also what earns the trailing chevron back: it promises a submenu
                only where one now opens. */}
