// gateway's landing page, and painting one of those only to swap it for another
// is worse than waiting one same-origin round trip. A failure hands App null,
// which says the gateway is unreachable instead of guessing a deployment.
// Shorter than apiFetch's 30s default, because nothing at all is on screen until
// this settles: a stalled gateway or proxy would otherwise hold a blank page for
// half a minute before the error state appears. A refused connection fails fast
// and never reaches this deadline; a healthy gateway answers immediately, since
// the route reads configuration plus two primary-key lookups for whether the
// bootstrap operator holds a password (which credential the sign-in screen
// should ask for). A database the gateway cannot reach answers "no sign-in
// methods" instead of hanging, but a merely slow or pool-starved one does not: with
// `db_pool_timeout` defaulting to 30s, waiting for a connection can outlast
// this deadline, and then it is this timeout rather than the gateway that
// decides. Both land on the same screen, which says the gateway is unreachable.
