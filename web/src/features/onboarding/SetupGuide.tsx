 * never served a request has nothing on it worth reading, so the guide takes
 * the screen the way the platform's flow did, offers a way out in its footer,
 * and never returns once that is taken. It composes with the Overview's own
 * getting-started panel rather than competing with it: that one is shown while
 * the gateway has no provider, when a request cannot succeed yet, and this one
 * takes over once one exists.
 *
 * **Offered on either Overview.** Who may be offered it is the server's answer
 * (`experience_eligible`, which ends in `has_workspace_management_access`), so
 * it goes to whoever manages the workspace: on a multi-tenant deployment a
 * tenant, and not the person who operates the deployment.
 *
 * Mounted from the Overview rather than from the shell, which is where
 * `canServeRequests` is answered and where a new operator lands.
