/**
 * The first-run sheet: one screen, one job, which is to get a request into a
 * new workspace.
 *
 * **A sheet rather than a panel on the page**, which is what the platform's
 * flow was and what this replaces. Nothing else on a dashboard with no traffic
 * in it is worth reading, so the guide is allowed to be the screen; it offers a
 * way out in the footer and never comes back once taken.
 *
 * **Divided rather than stacked.** Each part is a `DialogSection`, so the key,
 * the example and the wait are separated by hairlines that run the width of the
 * frame. A column of gaps would have read as three cards floating in a sheet,
 * which is the thing this design system does not do.
 *
 * Presentational, and controlled by `SetupGuide` above it: every piece of state
 * here is either the tab somebody picked or whether the key is on screen.
