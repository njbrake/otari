// The card is rasterized to a PNG and posted publicly, which makes it a different
// medium from the dashboard it draws on, and the differences are load-bearing:
//
//  - Feed scale, not full size. A single image renders around 500px wide in a
//    timeline and as little as 130px in a grid or a quoted post. Nothing here may
//    fall below FLOOR_PX at 1080, which is roughly 13px once the feed scales it
//    down. That rule is what caps the payload at a hero, three model rows, and
//    three secondary stats: everything else was unreadable anyway.
//  - Its own palette, not the app's tokens. `--color-surface` is #ffffff, so a
//    token-driven card dissolves into a light-mode timeline and reads as exactly
//    the screenshot this feature exists to beat. These constants are card-local on
//    purpose: the foundation's dark theme dresses the dashboard on a dark display,
//    while these two dress an image posted into someone else's timeline, so the
//    card's `theme` prop is the poster's choice and not the viewer's.
//  - Literal colors, no `var(--color-*)`. Custom properties do not resolve inside
//    an SVG document loaded through an `<img>` element, which is how this is
//    rasterized, so a token reference here renders as nothing. This file is the
//    one documented exception to the no-raw-hex rule in foundation.test.ts.
