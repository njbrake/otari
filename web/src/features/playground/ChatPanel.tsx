/**
 * One model's side of the conversation.
 *
 * A list and nothing else: no scroll container of its own, which is the
 * deliberate part. The shell already scrolls the page, and a transcript that
 * scrolled inside it would put a second scrollbar inside the first, which is
 * both worse on a phone and impossible to reason about while comparing (two
 * inner scrollbars beside each other, neither of which is the one the wheel is
 * over). Following the conversation down is the page's job for the same reason:
 * there is one scroll position, so there is one place to decide about it, and
 * `PlaygroundPage` owns it.
