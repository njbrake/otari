/**
 * "Which is better?", under a comparison both models have answered.
 *
 * The bar is what makes a comparison a recorded judgment rather than two
 * answers somebody read: the table it writes to is only worth having if every
 * row is a deliberate press, which is why there is no Save that rates by
 * default.
 *
 * Each control sits under the column it votes for, centred in that column's
 * half, so which model a press is about is read from position rather than from
 * the label. The labels still say it, for anyone not reading positionally.
 *
 * Three verdicts, not two: the stored vocabulary has always had a tie, and the
 * history list renders one, so offering only the two thumbs made an outcome the
 * dataset can hold unreachable from the page that fills it. It sits in the
 * middle, where the question is, because a tie is not about either column.
