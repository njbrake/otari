// Members and spend identities are two tables that have not merged yet. Keys,
// budgets, and usage attach to the gateway's string-keyed `users` row; a member
// is a UUID identity. `attribution_user_id` is the join between them, minted
// when the member is created, and it is what lets a key be issued to a person
// rather than to an opaque id. otari-ai#1727 decides how the two converge, and
// this map becomes the identity function and can go when they do.
//
// A member whose `attribution_user_id` is null has no usable row (nobody minted
// one, or it was soft-deleted through `DELETE /v1/users`), and key
// creation would refuse them. Those are left out rather than mapped, so nothing
// offers an owner the server will reject.
