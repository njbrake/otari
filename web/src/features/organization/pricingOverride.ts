 * Why a period would be refused, or undefined if it would be accepted.

 * The period is half-open, `[from, to)`, so an end equal to the start covers no

 * rule (`validate_period`), stated here as a sentence.
 *
 * Each field is judged on its own, and that matters more than it looks. Blank is
 * legitimate on both sides (a start defaults to now, an absent end is open
 * ended), but a value that is present and *unparseable* is not the same thing:
 * `fromLocalInput` turns it into `null`, which the server reads as "starts now"
 * or "no end". So an early return that only looked at blankness would let a
 * half-typed date enable Save, store a period the operator did not ask for, and
 * skip the overlap check on the way (`Date.parse` yields `NaN`, and every
 * comparison against `NaN` is false, so nothing looks like it overlaps).
 *
 * A blank start is compared against *now* rather than skipped, because that is
 * what the dialog submits for it: leaving the start blank and setting an end in
 * the past would otherwise keep Save enabled and earn a 400, which is the one
 * outcome this module exists to prevent. `now` is injectable so a test can pin it.
