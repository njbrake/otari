// Custom values are allowed and the field degrades to a plain text box when the
// dial fails: neither the provider's list nor its silence is authoritative, and
// a backend that publishes no list is exactly the case this dialog exists for.

// No rate here. An organization's rates live in `organization_model_pricing`
// and are written through the rate editor on the page above, so a price set in
// two places could not disagree about what a request costs. A model offered
// with no rate anywhere is recorded and not served until one appears.
