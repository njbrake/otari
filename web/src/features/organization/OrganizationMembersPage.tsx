// What a member spends and what their keys may call live on the gateway's own
// `users` row, not on the membership: `organization_member` has no such columns.
// `attribution_user_id` is the join, and it is nullable: null when no usable
// gateway row exists, whether because none was ever minted for this member or
// because it was soft-deleted afterwards. Those cells stay empty rather than
// reading as zero, which would claim the person is on the gateway and has spent
