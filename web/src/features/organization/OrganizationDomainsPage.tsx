// Email-domain auto-join: anyone who signs in with a verified address at a
// domain this organization has *proven* it controls becomes a member, at the
// role the claim names.
//
// The page is built around one asymmetry. Claiming a domain is free and means
// nothing, and it is the DNS record that makes a claim act on anybody, so a
// pending claim is shown as inert rather than as a step someone forgot: the row
// says what it will do once verified, and the record to publish is the most
// prominent thing on it. Without that framing an unverified claim reads as
// working, and the one thing worse than a claim that does nothing is believing
// a claim is guarding a domain when it is not.
//
// Owner and admin are deliberately missing from the role picker, matching
// `ORGANIZATION_DOMAIN_ROLES` on the server: publishing a DNS record proves
// control of a domain, which is not a decision about any one person, so it must
// never be enough to mint someone who can manage the organization.
//
// A proof expires, so "verified" is not a terminal state and the page has three
// of them rather than two: never proven, proven, and proven-but-stale. The last
// gets the same card as the first, because the admin's next action is the same.
