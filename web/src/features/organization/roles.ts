 * The fixed roles and statuses the tenancy surface is written in.

 * Fixed roles are the settled OSS line (`MANAGEMENT_ROLES` in
 * `src/gateway/models/tenancy.py`): four roles, of which two manage. Anything
 * finer-grained is overlay depth, so these lists are deliberately literal rather
 * than fetched, and the server refuses a role it does not know either way.
 *
 * The predicates below are the client half of gates the server already enforces.
 * They exist so a control that would always be refused is disabled rather than
 * offered, never to decide who may do what.
 *
 * `canManage` is deliberately **narrower** than the server, in the safe
 * direction. The server also lets an active owner or admin of one workspace
 * manage that workspace, and the organization pages have no selected workspace
 * to ask about. Use `canManageWorkspace` on the workspace-scoped pages.
 *
 * Superuser status is deployment authority, not an organization or workspace
 * role, and the server ignores it for tenant-scoped access.
 * No predicate here should check it.
