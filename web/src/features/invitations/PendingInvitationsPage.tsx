/**
 * The invitee's inbox: which organizations are waiting on the signed-in
 * identity, and the two things they can do about each (otari-ai#1999).
 *
 * The counterpart to `AcceptInvitationPage`, and deliberately a separate page
 * rather than a mode of it. That one is reached before the auth gate by
 * somebody holding nothing but a token, and everything about it follows from
 * that: it takes no identity, mints no session, and hands off to the claim
 * flow. This one is behind the gate, addresses an invitation by membership id
 * rather than by token, and exists because losing the email used to leave an
 * invitation reachable by nothing at all.
 *
 * Not in a sidebar rail. It is a chrome destination like `/account` and
 * `/docs`: a permanent row for something that is empty almost always would
 * read as a section of the product. The organization switcher surfaces it
 * instead, and only while something is actually waiting.
