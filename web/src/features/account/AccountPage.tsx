 * configuration: every row there is a gateway-wide setting an operator changes
 * on behalf of the process, while these are the credentials that identify the
 * person changing them. It is also the destination the account menu has always
 * named and could not open, and the surface the rest of #653's auth affordances
 * land on as their backends arrive: connected sign-in providers (otari#651)
