 * Three states this card refuses to conflate, because each has a different way
 * out:
 *
 * - **The browser cannot do passkeys at all** (no `PublicKeyCredential`, or an
 *   insecure context). Nothing here would work, so the register button is not
 *   offered and the reason is said. Checked before the query, because it does
 *   not depend on the answer.
 * - **The deployment is not configured for them.** `GET /v1/auth/webauthn/credentials`
 *   answers 503 naming the setting an operator has to fill in, and that message
 *   is shown rather than replaced with a friendlier one that hides the fix.
 * - **The prompt was dismissed.** Not a failure: `PasskeyCancelledError` is
 *   swallowed, because reporting "that passkey could not be verified" at
 *   somebody who pressed Escape is the dashboard telling them their hardware
 *   broke.
