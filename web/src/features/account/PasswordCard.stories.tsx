/**
 * Set a password, claim a deployment with one, or change one.
 *
 * Which of the three the card offers is read from the *caller* on the
 * membership context and not from a prop: `has_password` says whether a current
 * password has to be proved, and the address says whether one has to be
 * supplied. Those are the two conditions `PUT /v1/auth/password` branches on, so
 * `parameters.api` is the switch for these stories.
 *
 * The form itself is a dialog, which is what the card's action opens. Claiming
 * is one-way and retires the master key as a sign-in for the whole deployment,
 * which is why it is a card of its own rather than a field on a settings page.
