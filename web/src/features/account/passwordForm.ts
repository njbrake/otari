 *
 * Both flags are the caller's own state and neither is the deployment's, which
 * is the correction behind mozilla-ai/otari-ai#2099: `sign_in_methods` says
 * which credentials this gateway accepts, and the form turns on which one the
 * person reading it holds. They are also exactly the two conditions
 * `PUT /v1/auth/password` branches on, so a form built from them cannot ask for
 * a field the gateway ignores or omit one it requires.
 *
 * Shared by the card and the dialog rather than derived twice: the control that
 * opens the form and the one that completes it have to say the same words, and
 * `FormDialog` makes that a contract.
