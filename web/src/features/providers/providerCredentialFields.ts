// What one provider needs in `client_args` beyond an API key, described well
// enough for a form to ask for it.
//
// `client_args` is forwarded verbatim to the provider's client constructor
// (`AnyLLM.create(provider, api_key=…, api_base=…, **client_args)`), so its
// contents are whichever keyword arguments that SDK takes. For almost every
// provider that is optional transport tuning and a JSON textarea is the honest
// control. Bedrock is the exception: boto3 builds no client without
// `region_name`, and a credential omitted from a free-text JSON box surfaces
// as a provider error on the first request rather than as a validation error
// on the form.
//
// The registry lives here rather than being published by the gateway on
// purpose. `client_args` is a passthrough on every otari code path that reads
// an organization key, so there is no server-side call built from these specs
// for the form to drift away from; the authority for the names below is
// any-llm and boto3, which a server-side copy would be paraphrasing just as
// this one does. The endpoint that would carry it, `/providers/catalog`, is
// `require_deployment_operator`-gated, and the page that most needs these
// fields (`/organization/provider-keys`) is used by organization owners and
// admins who hold no deployment authority. Publishing it there would mean
// either a 403 on the page that needs it or a new public route for what is
// static, per-release data with no deployment variance.
//
// The names are boto3's own, and nothing between this file and the SDK call
// validates them: `org_provider_key_service` hands `client_args` to
// `provider_kwargs.get_provider_kwargs`, which spreads it into `AnyLLM.create`.
// `providerCredentialFields.test.ts` pins them against a silent edit here, not
// against an upstream rename, which still surfaces as a provider error at
// request time. `services/bedrock_gateway_auth.py` builds the same names on the
// hybrid path, out of the platform's `extra_params` rather than out of these.
