/**
 * The sign-in screen, rendering whichever credential this deployment accepts.
 *
 * A standalone gateway takes the master key until an operator claims it by
 * setting a password (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716), and takes a password from
 * whichever identity holds one, whenever one does. The gateway publishes both
 * facts in the bootstrap's `sign_in_methods`, so the form is chosen from that
 * rather than from a refusal: presenting the master-key box to a claimed
 * deployment would ask for the one credential its sign-in endpoint no longer
 * takes.
 *
 * The two are not alternatives to each other, which is what otari-ai#2100 was
 * about. A deployment publishes both whenever a member holds a password on one
 * its operator never claimed, and this screen used to show the master-key box
 * alone, so the member whose password would have worked had no form to put it
 * in. With both published the password form is what renders, and the
 * master-key box is one press away under the rule below it: somebody holding a
 * key knows they hold one, and everybody else would be reading a box about a
 * credential they have never seen.
 *
 * Below the form sit the ways in that are not a credential: claiming a rostered
 * identity, recovering a forgotten password, and asking for a fresh
 * verification link (otari#650, the pages in `publicAuthPaths.ts`). All three
 * start by sending a message, so all three are hidden on a deployment whose
 * bootstrap reports `mail_ready: false` rather than offered and then refused
 * with a 503, the way otari#648 already settled it for the invitation form.
 * The two recovery links need one thing more: `password` in that same list,
 * which is the gateway saying some identity holds one. Nothing has a reset link
 * to reset before then, and an operator who has not claimed the deployment
 * recovers through the master key against `PUT /v1/auth/password` instead (see
 * docs/access-control.md) rather than through a mailed link.
 *
 * A passkey signs in beside the form rather than instead of it (otari#652),
 * offered only when the gateway publishes `passkey` *and* this browser can run
 * the ceremony. OAuth sits beside both (otari#651), one button per provider in
 * the bootstrap's `oauth_providers`, which lists only the providers an operator
 * configured: a provider nobody set up is absent rather than rendered disabled,
 * and a deployment that configured none carries no OAuth affordance at all.
 *
 * Refusals render on the field label, and empty fields remain submittable so
 * validation can explain what to enter.
