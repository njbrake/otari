/**
 * `#/signup`: set a password for an address, claiming or registering it.
 *
 * Which of the two is the deployment's own posture, published as `open_signup`
 * in the bootstrap (otari-ai#2100). Closed, the default, `POST /v1/auth/signup`
 * only ever completes an identity `organization_service` already added or
 * invited by address and creates nothing from nothing, so the copy says so:
 * a page reading as "create an account" would leave somebody who is not on the
 * roster waiting for an email that is never sent. Open, an address nobody has
 * added is registered with an organization of its own, and the same page is a
 * registration form. The form itself is identical either way; only the wording
 * moves, because the request is the same one.
 *
 * **The response says nothing about the address**, under either posture. It is
 * enumeration-safe: unknown, already claimed, and genuinely just claimed all
 * answer the same sentence. So success navigates to `#/check-email`, which is
 * written in the conditional the server's own message uses, and nothing here
 * branches on what came back.
 *
 * The platform's Google and GitHub buttons and its newsletter opt-in are left
 * behind: the first is #651 and the second a hosted marketing concern. Its
 * terms checkbox is here, conditionally, because the objection to it was that a
 * deployment publishing no terms has nothing to link to; `terms_url` answers
 * that, and the server has carried `terms_accepted` and its
 * `terms_accepted_at` column throughout. Where there is a document, accepting
 * it is required, which is what makes the recorded acceptance mean anything.
 *
 * `?email=…` prefills the address for a link that names an invited one
 * (otari#835); the accept-invitation page sets a first password itself, so
 * it no longer sends anyone here. It arrives read-only, because the invitation
 * is bound to that address and claiming a different one would answer with the
 * same enumeration-safe sentence while doing nothing at all. The footer offers
 * the plain page for anyone who does need another address. Not a credential
 * and not treated as one: `POST /v1/auth/signup` checks this address against
 * the roster itself.
