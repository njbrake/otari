/**
 * A link between two pages that both live in front of the router.
 *
 * The `href` is a hash path, not TanStack Router's `<Link to>`, which the
 * house style otherwise requires for an internal destination. These pages are
 * rendered by `DeploymentRoot` *ahead* of `RouterProvider` (see `App.tsx`), so
 * there is no router context to link through; and a hash change is not the
 * full page reload that rule exists to prevent, because `App`'s `useHashPath`
 * picks it up and swaps the page in place. The `/welcome` links on `AuthHelp`
 * and `AcceptInvitationPage` are a HeroUI `Link` of their own rather than this,
 * and stay that way: on the deployments that offer it at all, `/welcome` is a
 * path the gateway serves, so it is the one link down here that *is* a page
 * load. Which deployments those are is `welcomeGuideHref`'s answer.
 *
 * Sized to the 44px touch target the phone viewport asks for, which `text-sm`
 * alone is about half of, and these stack several deep in a card's footer.
