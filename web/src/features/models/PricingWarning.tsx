// A gateway-wide alarm, shown on every management page: when `require_pricing` is
// on but `default_pricing` is off, every request for an unpriced model is being
// rejected (402). It lives in the app shell rather than any one page so an
// operator sees it regardless of where they are, or how the state arose (e.g.
// flipping require_pricing on via config long after onboarding). Dismissible per
// tab; it reappears on reload while the condition holds.
//
// The banner also carries a live count of requests that failed in the last hour,
// so the reject state reads as an active incident (traffic is being dropped right
// now) rather than a static config note, and links into the activity log filtered
// to those failures.

  // refused query: without it every tenant page load fired a `GET /v1/settings`
  // that 403s to feed a banner that could never render for them (#834). Off the

  // `useProviderKeyEncryption` does: a second request to ask the same question

    // that reports traffic being dropped is worth the shift.

    // breakpoint, and the sentence ran the whole window past the cap. It
    // cannot line up with the page's column on a wide viewport, because this
    // sits above the rail rather than beside it and the rail offsets `<main>`;
    // what the cap buys is a bounded measure rather than an alignment.
