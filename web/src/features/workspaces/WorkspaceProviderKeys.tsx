 * One workspace's departures from the provider keys its organization holds.

 * The other half of `OrganizationProviderKeysPage`: that page owns the
 * credentials themselves, this owns what one workspace does with them. Absence
 * of an override is full inheritance, so every row starts at "Inherited" and a
 * departure is something an admin chose.
 *
 * The three states are the two stored flags plus their absence, because the
 * gateway stores no no-op row (see `WorkspaceProviderKeyOverrideRequest`):
 * pinning is `is_default`, opting out is `disabled`, and inheriting is the row
 * being deleted. One flag is sent at a time and the other is left to
 * auto-resolve, which is what the tri-state request is for.
 *
 * The allow-list is per (workspace, key) and narrows rather than widens: no
 * entries means every model that key serves. It is what
 * `services/tenancy/organization_model_access.py` reads when it builds a
 * session's catalog scope, so emptying a workspace's catalog here also takes
 * `/models` down to nothing for it, and with it the first-request setup guide
 * that asks the same endpoint whether a call could succeed (#980).
