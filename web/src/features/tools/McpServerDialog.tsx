// The form behind both Add and Edit, one component rather than two: the only

//
// **The token has three states, not two.** The server never returns it, only
// whether one is stored (`has_token`), so an empty box cannot mean "no token":
// it means "I was shown nothing and typed nothing". The endpoint spells the
// three out (`WorkspaceMcpServerUpdate`) and this dialog maps a form onto them:
// leave the box alone to keep the stored token, type a value to rotate it, or
// tick Remove to clear it. That is why an edit sends every other field back and
// still omits this one.
