 * than on the queries because the hooks do not all take an `enabled` flag, and
 * a component that is not rendered runs none of them: that is what keeps a
 * tenant's first page from being a row of failed requests.
 *
 * Decided from the organization context, which is where `useUsageScope` and the
 * nav rail take the same answer from, so nothing on screen can hold a different
 * one (otari-ai#1936). Two sources compose into a page that reports nothing
 * while being wrong: the deployment-wide panels beside usage tiles quietly
 * reading `/organizations/me/usage`, every number disagreeing with its
 * neighbor and each query happy with its own. It also costs no request, since
 * the shell reads this context before it paints.
 *
 * So it fails toward the scoped page, the direction the hooks behind those tiles
 * already fail in: the narrower surface understates rather than refusing, and
 * reports its own error where this page can show it. An errored context is an
 * answer, not a wait, for `useUsageScope`'s reason: holding the page on a
 * loading state that no retry clears renders nothing at all.

 * stays inside the plot; vertically at 72%, so a bar near the top does not push
