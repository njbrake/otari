// Spend & budgets, for an organization owner or admin.
//
// The tenant-scoped half of `BudgetsPage`, which keeps the deployment-wide page
// an operator sees. The roles matrix (otari-ai#1943) puts this row at Edit for an
// admin and Hidden for a member, and before this it was operator-only end to
// end: `/budgets` gates every handler on `require_deployment_operator` and
// `/scoped-budgets` gates its whole router, so a hosted organization could
// manage neither its own caps nor where they applied.
//
// Two sections, because the schema has two objects and they answer different
// questions: a budget is *what a cap is*, and a ceiling is *who is capped*. They
// stay separate rather than merging into one table of "caps", because one budget
// is deliberately shared by several ceilings, and a merged row would have to
// either duplicate the figure or hide the sharing. The second is what makes
// raising a limit one edit rather than one per place it applies.
