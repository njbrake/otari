//
// In-flight requests stay out of the table for the same reason the log is

// the table continuously on a gateway with real traffic, and an operator cannot
// read a row before it moves. Off to one side, the same information costs the
// table nothing, and an operator who wants the live view opens it deliberately.
//
// The trade: a request does not resolve in place from live row into settled
// row. It leaves the list when it lands and appears in the log at the next
// refresh.

// The Button is a direct child of the popover root rather than wrapped in
