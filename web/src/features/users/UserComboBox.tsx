// know). This is the dashboard's user-first gate; it never mints an anonymous
// virtual user the way an omitted id at the API would. Virtual users are left out
// of the options: you attach keys to people/teams you name, not to key-shadows.
//
// `value` is the owner id, never the name shown for it. Picking a row is how an
// existing person is chosen; typed text is an id of its own, so typing somebody's
// display name names a new user rather than resolving to their UUID.
