 * `url` and nothing else, apart from whatever destinations the test wants to
 * observe. It is returned as a `wrapper`, which is what `render` and
 * `renderHook` take.
 *
 * The router is built once per `withRouter()` call, so each test gets its own
 * history and a re-render never resets the location mid-test.
 *
 * Memory history, where the app runs on hash history, so a `Link` renders
 * `/activity?status=error` here and `/#/activity?status=error` in the browser.
 * That is deliberate: hash history in jsdom would share one global
 * `window.location` across tests and make them order-dependent. It does mean an
 * href assertion below pins the path and query but not the shipped hash prefix,
 * so the hash form is asserted in `web/e2e` instead.
