/**
 * The deployment context the shell renders from, read once per page load.
 *
 * `main.tsx` fetches `/bootstrap` before it mounts anything and hands the
 * answer to `App`, which puts it here. That ordering is the point: which
 * deployment served this page decides whether a sign-in screen, a management
 * dashboard, or a data-plane landing page is the right first paint, so the app
 * must not have to guess it and then correct itself.
 *
 * It lives in `shared/` rather than in `app/` because features read it and a
 * feature may not import the composition root. It is a context rather than a
 * query because it describes the server that served this page: it cannot change
 * without a reload, and it must survive the cache clear a sign-out performs.
 *
 * One field is the exception, and it is the reason this provider holds state at
 * all: `sign_in_methods`, which the app itself can change. Claiming a
 * deployment retires master-key sign-in (`PUT /v1/auth/password`, otari#649),
 * which is the app changing the server's answer rather than the server
 * changing it underneath: `sign_in_methods` goes from `["master_key"]` to
 * `["password"]` the moment that call succeeds, and the response says so in
 * `master_key_sign_in_retired`. That field is the server's own answer and not
 * "this call succeeded": only the operator's password claims the deployment
 * (otari#702), so a member changing theirs on an unclaimed one gets `false` and
 * nothing here moves. Every consumer of that fact has to move together, or the
 * tab that claimed keeps a sign-in screen offering the credential the gateway
 * now refuses and a password page that asks to claim a deployment already
 * claimed. So the claim reports itself through `useRetireMasterKeySignIn` and
 * this provider serves the corrected bootstrap from then on.
