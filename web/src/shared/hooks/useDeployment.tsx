/**
 * The deployment context the shell renders from, read once per page load.
 *
 * `main.tsx` fetches `/bootstrap` before it mounts anything and hands the
 * answer to `App`, which puts it here. That ordering is the point: which
 * deployment served this page decides whether a sign-in screen, a management
 * dashboard, or a data-plane landing page is the right first paint, so the app
 * must not have to guess it and then correct itself.
 *
 * It lives in `shared/` rather than in `app/` because features read it and a
 * feature may not import the composition root. It is a context rather than a
 * query because it describes the server that served this page: it cannot change
 * without a reload, and it must survive the cache clear a sign-out performs.
 *
 * One field is the exception, and it is the reason this provider holds state at
 * all: `sign_in_methods`, which the app itself can change. Two acts change it.
 *
 * Claiming a deployment retires master-key sign-in
 * (`PUT /v1/auth/password`, otari#649), which is the app changing the server's
 * answer rather than the server changing it underneath: `sign_in_methods` goes
 * from `["master_key"]` to `["password"]` the moment that call succeeds, and
 * the response says so in `master_key_sign_in_retired`. That field is the
 * server's own answer and not "this call succeeded": only the operator's
 * password claims the deployment (otari#702), so a member changing theirs on an
 * unclaimed one gets `false` and nothing here moves. Every consumer of that
 * fact has to move together, or the tab that claimed keeps a sign-in screen
 * offering the credential the gateway now refuses and a password page that asks
 * to claim a deployment already claimed. So the claim reports itself through
 * `useRetireMasterKeySignIn` and this provider serves the corrected bootstrap
 * from then on.
 *
 * Registering the first passkey, or deleting the last one, is the second
 * (otari#652): the gateway publishes `passkey` exactly while some credential
 * could answer a sign-in, so the account page reports the change through
 * `useOfferPasskeySignIn`. Unlike the claim this one is reversible, because
 * deleting a passkey is, so it carries the value rather than being one-way.
