/**
 * Runnable "make a request" snippets, for the two places that hand out a key.

 * beside the key it issues, so they live here rather than in either feature: two
 * copies would drift into two dialects of the same call, and an operator who
 * followed one and then the other would be told to authenticate two ways.
 *
 * The base URL is usually the browser's own origin, because the gateway serving
 * this dashboard is also the gateway serving the API: whatever address reached
 * this page is an address that reaches `/chat/completions`, which is more
 * reliable than anything a server behind a proxy could report about itself.
 *
 * A hosted control plane breaks that, which is what `resolveSnippetBaseUrl`
 * below exists for: it serves the dashboard and is deliberately not where
 * inference belongs (otari#823, otari#822), so it publishes the data-plane
 * gateway's address on `/bootstrap` and the snippets are built from that.

 * say about itself from behind a proxy. A hosted control plane is the exception

 * name that address itself (`data_plane_url` on `/bootstrap`).
 *
 * Undefined when a hosted deployment names none. Falling back to the origin
 * there is the bug this replaces: it hands somebody a runnable command aimed at
 * the one host their traffic should not reach. A placeholder host would be no
 * better, since nobody reading it can know what to put in its place, so the
 * caller shows no snippet and says why. Undefined and never `""`, so that a
 * caller cannot build `curl /api/v1/chat/completions` out of an origin that is not
 * there; this is the boundary where the bootstrap's `null` becomes the absent
 * value the rest of the tree branches on.
 *
 * `data_plane_url` is read whichever mode published it, but only a hosted
 * deployment does: `bootstrap.py` answers null for standalone and hybrid even
 * when the setting is present, because each of those serves its own API. The
 * trailing slash is trimmed again here because this is the value the gateway
