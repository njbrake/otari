// How the dashboard's URLs encode their query string.
//
// Every search param the pages read is a flat string, and a repeated key
// (`?model=a&model=b`) is that filter's whole value set. TanStack Router's
// default codec JSON-encodes values instead, which would rewrite that as
// `?model=["a","b"]`. These URLs are hand-written, shared and bookmarked (the
// e2e suite opens them directly, and Usage links into Activity with repeated
// params), so the router is handed this codec and every existing link keeps
// working unchanged.
