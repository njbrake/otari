/**
 * The review block on a deprecated component, made mechanical.
 *
 * `web/design/DESIGN.md` has kept a prose table of components that must not be
 * used in new code, with "adding a new one is a review block" enforced by a
 * human noticing. This directory is what turned the table into a location, and
 * this file is what turns the location into a gate.
 *
 * A gate rather than a Biome rule, deliberately. `noRestrictedImports` would be
 * shorter, but every existing call site is a violation of it, so it would need a
 * `biome-ignore` in each of the five feature files and the ignore would be the
 * thing that has to be maintained. Naming the call sites here instead keeps them
 * in one list, next to what each of them should become, and reports a *new* one
 * with that replacement rather than with a rule name.
 *
 * Converting a call site is welcome: delete its row. The count only goes down.

 * own counts had drifted: DESIGN.md placed `StatCard` on "Overview, Usage" when
 * Usage had stopped using it, and buttons.md put `RowActions` on two call sites
 * when it was on one.
 *
 * Empty does not mean deletable, and this is the thing to read before acting on
 * a zero here. This walk covers `web/src` and nothing else, while otari-ai's
 * overlay is written against this tree (`frontend/tsconfig.json`: "overlay/otari
 * is written against otari's tree (its `@` is otari/web/src)"), so its
 * `@/shared/components/deprecated/...` imports resolve to these very files and
 * are invisible from here. As of 2026-09-18 that overlay holds `StatCard` in
 * one file and `RowActions` in two, so deleting either module would break the
 * superset build, and break it in the other repository's separate
 * `type-check:superset` leg rather than in this one. Confirm against that repo
 * before removing a module, not against this map.
