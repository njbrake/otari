 * deliberately no way for an operator to set somebody else's password. The
 * first call on a deployment supplies an address as well, which is the act that
 * claims it and retires master-key sign-in (otari-ai#1716).
 *
 * Two things this changes are cached elsewhere, and they are cached
 * differently. The bootstrap's `sign_in_methods` is a context read once per
 * load rather than a query, so no invalidation could reach it: the caller
 * reports the claim through `useRetireMasterKeySignIn` instead. The roster is
 * an ordinary query, and a claim writes `user.email` from null to the address,
 * so the Members page would otherwise show the row it fetched before the claim
 * for the rest of its `staleTime`. That one is invalidated here.
 *
 * Every *other* session this identity holds is revoked server-side; this one is
 * kept, so no 401 follows.

 * surface that draws a person falls back to the address from there.
 *
 * Two caches carry that name. The membership context is where the sidebar reads
 * it, and the response is exactly the `caller` it holds, so that one is seeded
 * from the answer before being invalidated: the account control renames itself
 * on the same tick rather than a round trip later. The roster is the other, where
 * `userDisplay` resolves a user id for Usage, Activity and Budgets. The context
 * is touched at its own key rather than at `[ORGANIZATIONS]`, which would re-read
 * the memberships list as well and nothing here moves it.

// A query rather than a mutation, the same shape `useValidateInvitation` takes
// and for a reason that outranks the fact that this one does write: the page
// verifies on arrival rather than behind a button, so *whatever* fires it has
// to fire exactly once per token, and a query keyed on the token is the only
// one of the two that the cache makes idempotent for free. A mutation fired
// from an effect is not: `main.tsx` runs under StrictMode, whose
// mount/unmount/mount would spend a single-use token twice and land the second
// call's `400` over the first call's success.
//
// The knobs are what keep it a one-shot, and they are spelled out here rather
// than leaning on the provider's defaults, because "fires once" is this hook's
// contract and not a coincidence of how the app is configured. Never stale and
// never collected, so a remount reads the answer back instead of asking again.
// No retry, because a spent token's `400` is the final answer and not a blip.
// And the three automatic refetches are off by name: staleness alone does not
// hold them back once a query has failed, since a failure leaves no data for
// `staleTime` to keep fresh, so without these a reconnect or a remount would
// re-POST a token that is already gone.
//
// POST with the token in the body rather than a GET with it in the URL, the
// same reasoning `useValidateInvitation` gives: the token is a bearer
// credential and a URL is what an access log or an intermediate proxy
// routinely retains.
