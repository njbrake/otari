// dropped, so the picker can say why a list is empty.

// 404: a gate cannot be built on a failed request, and hiding a destination
// grants nothing either way.
//
// Read by the deployment accounts page alone, to word its own refusal, and it
// holds that decision until this lands. Nothing else asks: the rail and the
// Overview index need the answer before their first paint, so they take
// `deployment_operator` off the organization context, which is the same
// server-side predicate on a read the shell already makes (otari#836).
