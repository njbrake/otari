// One page of usage-log rows for the Activity viewer, newest first.
// Which of the two usage surfaces this caller may read.
//
// `/usage` is deployment-wide and refuses anyone who does not operate the
// deployment; `/organizations/me/usage` serves the same rows narrowed to the
// caller's own organization, to the workspaces they belong to within it
// (otari#837), and for a member or viewer to the requests billed to them. Both answer identical shapes, so every hook below differs only in
// the prefix it asks.
//
// Read off the organization context rather than `useDeploymentAdminAccess`,
// because the shell reads that context on every page anyway, so on all but the
// first paint the answer is already cached and no request goes to the wrong
// surface. `ready` covers the paint where it is not: an operator sent briefly to
// the scoped route would read their own organization's subset and quietly
// understate every total on screen, so the hooks wait rather than guess.
//
// **An errored context is ready, not still waiting.** It is the same question
// either way ("has the answer stopped being unknown"), and treating a failure as
// perpetual loading disables every usage hook for the session: the pages then
// issue no request at all and state that a gateway serving traffic has none,
// with nothing to report because nothing was asked. A suspended membership
// reaches this, since `_resolve_active_organization` 404s with no live
// membership to fall back to. So a failure falls through to the *narrower*
// surface, which is the safe direction (understating beats a cross-tenant read),
// and its own refusal is what the page reports. `AppShell` resolves the same
// error the same way, failing open rather than stranding the destinations behind
// it.
//
// The base is part of every query key it feeds, so two callers on one browser
// can never read each other's cached rows.
//
// `"organization"` pins the narrow surface regardless of who is asking. It
// exists for the organization-wide Usage page (otari-ai#1963), whose question is
// "this organization", so for an operator the caller-derived scope would answer
// a different one: `/usage` reads every tenant on the deployment, and a page
// titled with the organization would silently overstate it. A pinned base needs
// no context answer to be known, so it is ready on first paint.
