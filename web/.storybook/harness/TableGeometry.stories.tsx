/**
 * A measurement harness, not a catalog entry.
 *
 * It lives here rather than under `src/` because that is what keeps it out of
 * the published catalog: `main.ts`'s default glob covers `../src/**` only, and
 * this directory is added to it just for `STORYBOOK_HARNESS=1`. An earlier
 * version sat in `src/` and tried to exclude itself with a `!` pattern, which
 * Storybook ignores, so it published. Its reader is
 * `.storybook/__tableGeometry.mjs`, which renders this one story and reports the
 * computed geometry of every lane; run it before and after a change to table
 * CSS and diff the two, which is the check the screenshot suite would give if it
 * were a gate.
 *
 * It renders `DataTable` inside every per-feature wrapper class the stylesheet
 * targets, with exactly the column ids that stylesheet names. Both were derived
 * from globals.css rather than transcribed from the feature files, so it
 * measures what the CSS actually reaches rather than what a feature is believed
 * to pass.
 *
 * **It is the one file in `src/design-system/` that names application classes**,
 * and it does so as strings rather than imports, so the layer's boundary rule
 * (which is about imports) does not catch it. That is deliberate and it is the
 * honest exception: extraction leaves this file behind, because a design system
 * has no business knowing that a keys page exists. If the layer is ever lifted
 * into a package, this belongs with the application.
