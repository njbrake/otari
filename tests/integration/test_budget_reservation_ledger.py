"""The reservation ledger: one row per in-flight hold, and what that row buys.

``users.reserved`` and ``scoped_budgets.reserved_spend`` were counters with no
identity behind them (mozilla-ai/otari#742), so two things the gateway is
supposed to guarantee were unreachable: a release could not tell whether it had
already run, and a leaked hold could be seen only in aggregate. These cover both,
plus the paths that deliberately write no row.

The counters themselves are covered by ``test_scoped_budgets.py`` and
``test_budget_race_condition.py``; nothing here re-asserts how a hold is taken.
