"""The member-scoped key surface touches the caller's own keys and no more.

``/api/v1/keys`` is deployment-wide and operator-only (otari-ai#1880), which left a
hosted organization member with no way to mint a key (mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1941).
``/api/v1/organizations/me/keys`` is the tenant's half of it, and the whole of its
correctness is that ownership and workspace scope are decided by the caller's
identity and memberships rather than by anything the request carries. So the
suite is written against a world holding two organizations, two members sharing
a workspace, and keys owned by each, and the assertions name the rows that must
be absent or refused rather than counting the ones that came back.

The control group at the bottom matters as much as the rest: the deployment-wide
router must still refuse a plain member, and a member-minted key must never be
budget-exempt. A change that made the rest pass by loosening either would have
reopened otari-ai#1880 or opened a budget bypass.
