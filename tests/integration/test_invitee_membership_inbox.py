"""The invitee's side of the invitation flow: list, accept, decline (otari-ai#1999).

Exercised at the service layer for the reason `test_tenancy_authorization.py`
gives: the API test client can only ever act as the one operator identity a
standalone deployment has, and every case here needs a *second* identity, the
one an invitation is addressed to. `test_invitations_api.py` covers the route
wiring over HTTP; the rules are here.

What the inbox is for is the case the emailed link serves worst: an address
that already holds an identity, invited to a second organization. Losing that
one email used to leave the invitation reachable by nothing.
