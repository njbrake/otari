"""What actually crosses ``GrowthSignalPort`` on a running app.

The port shipped fully wired and entirely uncalled (otari#796), which is a
failure nothing reports: the core adapter is a Null Object, so a build that
binds a real CRM gets a resolved port that is simply never reached and no test,
log line or type error says so. These tests close that by binding a recording
adapter through the container, the way an overlay binds its own, and asserting
on what the seam carried rather than on what the route answered.

The negatives carry as much as the positives. Signup's enumeration-safety is a
property of the *response*, and a signal fired on an address nobody has touched
would leak through the seam what the body refuses to say, so the untouched-address
case asserts silence. The second key asserts silence too: ``record_activation``
puts first-occurrence detection on the caller, and a milestone that fires on
every key is not a milestone.
