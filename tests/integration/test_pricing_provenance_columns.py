"""Pricing provenance on PostgreSQL: what SQLite cannot show about these columns.

Two things, and only on this engine: a ``varchar`` length is enforced rather than
advisory, so the ceilings copied from the platform's ``gateway_usage_settlement``
are real, and ``timezone=True`` is honored, so a provenance timestamp reads back
UTC-aware.

The revision's chain, including the downgrade and re-upgrade with rows in the
table, is covered on SQLite in
``tests/unit/test_pricing_provenance_schema_chain.py``. It is deliberately not
repeated here: the integration fixtures build the schema once per worker and
share it (``conftest._SCHEMA_READY``), so a downgrade whose restore fails would
leave every later test on that worker against a schema its models no longer
match, and ``ADD COLUMN ... NULL`` is not the DDL that needs a second engine to
be believed.
