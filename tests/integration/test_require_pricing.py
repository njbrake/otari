"""End-to-end tests for the require_pricing gate (F3) and its precedence.

These build a client with ``require_pricing=True`` (the production default; the
shared ``client`` fixture turns it off for the legacy suite). They cover the 402
route branch — exercised nowhere else — and verify that user/blocked/budget
rejections (404/403) take precedence over the missing-pricing rejection (402),
i.e. budget is reserved before the pricing gate is enforced.
