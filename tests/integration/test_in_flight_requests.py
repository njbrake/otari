"""GET /api/v1/usage/in-flight reports what the gateway is serving right now.

The usage log only records requests that have settled, so a slow backend (a local
model taking 30 seconds) is invisible while it runs. These tests pin the two
halves that make the live view trustworthy: a request is registered *during* its
provider call, and the entry is always gone once the response has been sent,
including on the streaming and failure paths where the route handler returns long
before the request is over.

The mid-flight assertions read the registry directly rather than calling the
endpoint: ``TestClient`` drives the app through a portal, so issuing a second
request from inside a stubbed provider call would re-enter the running loop. The
serialization the dashboard actually consumes is covered separately, against a
seeded registry.
