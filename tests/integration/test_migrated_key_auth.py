"""Route-level auth for a key that does not have the minted shape (issue #646).

Otari and otari-ai both store an unsalted SHA-256 hex digest of the whole
presented key, so a migrated ``tk_`` key's hash lands on an ``api_keys`` row
unchanged. The format check that used to run inside ``hash_key`` rejected such a
key with a 401 before the lookup ever happened; auth now depends on the row
alone, which is what makes a cutover re-issue unnecessary.
