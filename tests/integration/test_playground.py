"""The Playground serves one signed-in person, and only what is theirs.

Two things are load-bearing here and everything in this file is about one of
them.

**A completion runs as the caller, not as a key and not as the deployment.**
``/api/v1/chat/completions`` refuses a cookie on purpose, because a keyless
request resolves to the *default* workspace and honoring one there would let any
member of any organization spend the default organization's credential
(otari-ai#1880). The Playground's endpoint resolves the caller's own attribution
user and proves their membership of the workspace it will bill before the
pipeline sees anything, so the tests below assert on the rows that came out: the
usage row's ``user_id`` and its null ``api_key_id``, the workspace it was
stamped with, and the refusals for a workspace that is not the caller's.

**A stored row is readable only by its owner.** The hosted original leaked
prompts and model outputs across organizations because a list query trusted a
client-supplied scope (otari-ai#978). So every read and delete here is also
asserted from a second identity, and the expected answer is the 404 a
nonexistent row gets rather than a 403, which would confirm the row exists.

The world is two organizations because one cannot express either property: a
single-tenant fixture makes "the caller's workspace" and "the default workspace"
the same row, which is exactly the conflation both bugs were.
