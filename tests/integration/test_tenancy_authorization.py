"""The tenancy authorization rules, exercised at the service layer.

The API tests can only ever act as the one operator identity a standalone
deployment has, and that identity is an owner and a superuser, so the rules that
matter most (what a *non*-owner may do) are unreachable through the routes until
per-identity sign-in lands. They are reachable here, by calling the services with
identities built at whatever role the case needs, which is also the layer that
owns the rules.
