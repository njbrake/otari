"""OAuth sign-in end to end, with only the provider's own endpoints stubbed.

Everything on this side of the exchange is real: the routes, the container, the
``IdentityProviderPort`` adapter the base build binds, the roster it resolves
against, and the session cookie a sign-in mints. What is replaced is
apron-auth's outbound half, because a test cannot complete a consent screen.

That replacement is the reason
``tests/integration/test_oauth_live_provider.py`` exists: it is the check that
the request shape apron-auth actually sends is one Google and GitHub accept, and
