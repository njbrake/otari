"""The dashboard overview's summary endpoint.

Two halves, the way ``test_organization_budgets.py`` splits them.

The **HTTP surface** goes through the client, which can only act as the one
superuser operator a standalone deployment provisions. That covers the counts,
the scoping and the judgment.

The **rules that decide who sees which strip** are exercised at the service
layer, with identities built at whatever role a case needs, because the API
cannot act as a plain member.
