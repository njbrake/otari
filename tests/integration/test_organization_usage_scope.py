"""The organization-scoped usage reads see the caller's own organization and no more.

``/api/v1/usage`` is deployment-wide and operator-only since #821. These routes are
the tenant's half of it (otari#837), and the whole of their correctness is that
the row set is decided by the caller's membership rather than by anything the
request carries. So the suite is written against a world holding *two*
organizations with traffic in both, and every assertion names the rows that must
be absent rather than counting the ones that came back: a count can match by
accident, and "beta's model is not in this response" cannot.

Four things are asserted for each of the four routes:

- an owner reads every workspace in their organization, and none outside it;
- a member reads their own requests in the workspaces they belong to: not the
  sibling workspace they do not belong to, and not other people's requests in
  the workspace they share;
- ``workspace_id`` narrows and never widens, answering 404 outside the scope the
  way a workspace that does not exist does;
- the scope follows the *membership*, not the ``active_organization_id`` pointer,
  so pointing an identity at an organization it does not belong to grants
  nothing.

The last group is the control: the deployment-wide route must still refuse an
organization owner. A change that made these pass by loosening that gate would
have reopened otari-ai#1880, so it is asserted here as well as in
``test_deployment_operator_gate.py``.
