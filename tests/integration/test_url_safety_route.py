"""Route-level tests for the MCP-server URL SSRF safety check.

The check (`gateway.services.url_safety.validate_mcp_url`) used to run
synchronously inside a Pydantic `model_validator` at request-body-parse time,
which surfaced as a 422. It now runs from the async request pipeline (DNS
resolution must be awaited, and Pydantic validators can't await), so a
rejected URL surfaces as 400 instead. These tests lock in that behavior and
confirm the check still runs; no live MCP server is needed since the safety
check rejects before any network call.
