"""A hosted control plane serves the management plane and refuses inference.

The mirror of ``test_hybrid_mode_surface``, which asserts the opposite posture
for the opposite deployment. Regression cover for otari#822: hosted mode used to
mount every data-plane router alongside the management API, so a workspace key
pointed at the control plane host ran real inference that no wallet was ever
debited for.

On the worker's PostgreSQL like the rest of ``tests/integration``, not on a
SQLite file of its own: a hosted app boots against a real control plane's
database, and asserting a deployment posture on a backend the deployment never
runs on is the kind of shortcut that makes a green test mean less than it looks.
