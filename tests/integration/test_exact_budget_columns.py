"""What the exact budget columns refuse, at the API and at the migration.

``NUMERIC(18, 6)`` holds just under $1T where the float columns it replaced had
no ceiling (mozilla-ai/otari#691). A cap is the one amount here an operator types
by hand, and reaching for a very large number to mean "no limit" is a habit, so
both ends of that are covered: a request body naming a bigger cap is refused with
a 422 rather than reaching PostgreSQL and coming back as a 500, and a deployment
that already stored one, in either direction, is told which table and column
before the migration starts rather than after an ALTER fails.
