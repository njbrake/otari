"""A software authenticator, so the passkey tests exercise real verification.

The alternative was stubbing ``webauthn_service``'s two verify calls, which
would have left every test asserting that this deployment's own bookkeeping
works while the part that decides whether a passkey is genuine went unexercised.
This builds the payloads a browser and an authenticator actually produce, signs
them with a real P-256 key, and lets py_webauthn verify them, so a test that
passes is a ceremony that would pass in a browser.

What it deliberately does *not* do is model an authenticator's storage. A test
holds the key pair and says which credential answers, because the properties
under test are the server's (does a replayed challenge fail, does a credential
registered under another relying-party ID assert, does one identity's ceremony
complete against another's), and each of those is easier to state when the test
chooses the answer.

Everything here is the WebAuthn wire format at
https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/, which is why the byte offsets are spelled out
rather than abbreviated: an off-by-one in ``authData`` fails as an opaque
signature mismatch.
