"""Deployment-wide management routes admit only a deployment operator.

`api/deps.verify_master_key` answers *authenticated*, not *authorized*: a
dashboard session clears it for any active identity. Two families of router
declare it, and only one of them re-checks the caller afterwards. The
tenant-scoped family (organizations, workspaces, org provider keys, `/api/v1/admin`)
resolves `CurrentIdentity` and asks a service whether that identity may act on
the organization, workspace or deployment named; the deployment-wide family does
not, so clearing the credential check *was* the whole authorization there.

That gap is otari-ai#1880: a member of one organization, invited to nothing else,
held master-key authority over the whole process. It mints a key into another
organization's workspace (which then resolves that organization's BYO provider
credential and bills it), rotates the deployment master key, freezes sign-ins,
and drives the three credential-test endpoints at a URL of its choosing.

Both halves are asserted here, and the second half is the point: the control
cases at the bottom are what catches a fix that swung too wide and took the
tenant-scoped routers with it.

What the gate does over HTTP is this file. Where it is declared, and that it
covers every route on every deployment-wide router rather than the roster of
paths probed below, is `tests/unit/test_operator_gate_declarations.py`.
