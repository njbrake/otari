"""End-to-end coverage for gateway-side rejections landing in the usage log.

#449 made the missing-pricing rejection visible (an error row the dashboard's
failure count and activity log read); every other gate still raised without
writing anything, so the count read 0 and the activity log showed nothing while
an operator's traffic was being dropped for a key allow-list, a blocked or
over-budget user, a user/key mismatch, or a selector that stopped resolving.

Each test here pins one gate: the request is refused, a single error row appears
with no cost, and the row is an enforced gateway row
(``counts_toward_budget=True``) rather than an imported-looking one. The
dashboard offers ``counts_toward_budget=False`` rows for bulk delete and
set-price, which must never reach a row the gateway wrote itself, so that
assertion is repeated per gate rather than factored out.

The two deliberate omissions (an unauthenticated 401, and an unknown user whose
row could not satisfy the ``usage_logs.user_id`` foreign key) are pinned too, so
they stay decisions rather than regressions.

One gate needs an ordering test as well as a content test. Every gate here sits
behind ``check_rate_limit`` except the user/key mismatch, so that one charges the
key's own rate-limit bucket itself (``throttle_early_rejection``) instead of
letting a client loop mismatched requests and append a row per request. The last
two tests pin that on both scaffolds: the rows are bounded by the limit, and the
response the client sees is still the 403, never a 429.
