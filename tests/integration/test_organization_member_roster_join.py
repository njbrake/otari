The page used to fetch seven collections and stitch them together in the browser:
the roster, every gateway identity, every workspace, a roster read per workspace,
every budget and every spend ceiling (otari#1381). The joins are the server's
work, and doing them there is also what lets the page ask for one row at a time.
