"""End-to-end behavior for the weighted routing policy: load balancing traffic
across providers.

What these defend, each being a claim the feature makes on the wire rather than in
a helper:

* Traffic really lands on more than one provider, and the caller cannot tell: the
  response says the policy name whichever provider served.
* Every attempt is attributable after the fact. The usage row names the model that
  served and carries ``selection_reason: router:weighted``, which is the only
  record of the split, because a weighted decision is deliberately not logged per
  request.
* A failure stays inside the balanced pool before reaching ``on_failure``, so a
  provider having a bad minute sheds its share.
* A drained (zero-weight) candidate takes no traffic and still backs a failure.
* The split is bounded by the caller's allow-list, like every other policy.
* No pricing is required, unlike the learned router: weight is operator-declared
  capacity, not a number derived from cost.

The RNG is seeded through the backend the registry hands out, so these assert an
exact split rather than a distribution: a statistical assertion here would be a
flaky test that also tells you less.
