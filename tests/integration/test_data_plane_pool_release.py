"""The data plane hands every pooled connection back.

A leak here is what mozilla-ai/otari#1236 was: ``get_db_if_needed`` abandoned the
session it borrowed, so each inference request kept a pooled connection checked
out until the garbage collector got to it, and sustained traffic drained the
pool and turned every request into a 503.

Nothing caught it because the suite cannot see this path from the outside.
``build_test_client`` overrides ``get_db``, but the data-plane routes take their
session from ``get_db_if_needed``, which calls ``get_db`` as a plain function
rather than through ``Depends``, so the override never reaches them: the
inference routes run on the engine ``init_db`` built while the management routes
run on the test engine. Overriding ``get_db_if_needed`` too would make the suite
tidier and this class of bug permanently invisible, because the connection the
production dependency leaks is one the test engine would never have lent. So
these tests assert against the real engine's pool instead, which is also the
only place the count exists: ``checkedout`` belongs to ``AsyncAdaptedQueuePool``
and SQLite runs on ``NullPool``, so this is PostgreSQL-only and lives here
rather than in ``tests/unit``.
