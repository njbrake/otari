"""The migration chain and the models must describe the same schema.

Nothing else in the suite compares the two, which is how a model and its
migration can disagree and still pass CI. That is not hypothetical: within one
week this repo shipped an `index=True` the migration never created (so a
`create_all` schema and a migrated one differed, and `alembic revision
--autogenerate` would have proposed the missing index) and, in the same edit,
dropped `index=True` from an unrelated CASCADE foreign key whose index the
migration *does* create (so the model silently under-described a live index).
Both directions are drift, both were invisible to every existing test, and both
were caught by a human reading the diff.

The check builds the schema twice against the same PostgreSQL server, once by
running the migration chain and once through ``metadata.create_all``, and
compares what the database itself reports. Comparing the two rendered schemas
rather than diffing source is what makes it catch the second direction too: a
model that forgets a flag looks fine on its own, and only the comparison shows
the index it failed to mention.
