"""``/api/v1/users`` answers for the caller's organization and no other.

The router is deployment-wide and operator-only, which read as "so it may serve
every row" and did: ``list_users`` was an unfiltered select and the by-id routes
looked a user up by primary key alone, so an operator acting in one organization
read, re-budgeted and soft-deleted another's people, and ``POST /api/v1/keys``
took whatever ``user_id`` it was handed. ``/api/v1/keys`` had already settled the
same question the other way (otari#817), so the gap was between two routers
rather than in either one (otari-ai#2108).

``users`` carries no organization column, and could not: one identity's
attribution row serves every organization that person belongs to, and membership
is many-to-many. So the scope is derived, and this suite is written against the
derivation rather than against one route: a user is in reach through a key,
through usage, or through a roster row, and a user in reach of nothing anywhere
is shared.

Every assertion names the row that must be absent rather than counting what came
back, for the reason ``test_organization_usage_scope`` gives: a count matches by
accident, and "beta's user is not in this response" does not.
