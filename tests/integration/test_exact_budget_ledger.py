"""The spend ledger equals the settled rows that fed it, exactly.

``usage_logs.cost`` has been exact since mozilla-ai/otari#661, and the counters
the budget gate enforces against are exact as of mozilla-ai/otari#691. What that
buys is the invariant asserted here: over any number of requests,
``users.spend`` is the sum of the rows attributed to the user, with no residue.

Every amount here is compared exactly, and the first test also carries the
float-era addition alongside its assertion. That guard is the point: the drift a
float counter carried was far below a cent, so a suite that compared
approximately would keep passing on a counter that had quietly gone back to
binary floating point.
