"""The organization-scoped routing-policy read sees the caller's own workspaces and no more.

``/api/v1/routing/policies`` is deployment-wide and operator-only, and stays that
way: its ``workspace_id`` parameter is a filter the client supplies, so nothing
but the operator gate stands between a signed-in member and another
organization's routing. ``/api/v1/organizations/me/routing-policies`` is the
tenant's View half of it (otari-ai#1942), shaped like the usage scope
(otari#837), and this suite is that file's shape over the ``routing_policies``
table: two organizations with policies in both, and every assertion names the
rows that must be absent rather than counting the ones that came back.

The last test is the control: the deployment-wide route must still refuse an
organization owner. A change that made these pass by loosening that gate would
have reopened otari-ai#1880.
