"""The races the tenancy services resolve, driven concurrently.

Every check-then-act path here is decided by a unique constraint rather than by
its own pre-check, and the pre-check only makes the common case a clean 409. The
fixes for that are one ``except IntegrityError`` each, which is the kind of line
a later refactor removes without a test failing, so these drive the real race
with separate sessions rather than asserting the branch in isolation.
