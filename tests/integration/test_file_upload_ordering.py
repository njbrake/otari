"""An upload whose bytes never complete stays reachable, and the sweep reclaims it.

A refused upload gives its row and its bytes back at once, but both halves of
that are best effort. What covers a cleanup the store refuses is the row, which
is written before the write begins and so names whatever the write left. The
sweep walks those rows once they are past their grace, and leaves alone the ones
that may still be receiving their bytes.
