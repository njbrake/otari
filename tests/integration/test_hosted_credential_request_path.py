"""An overlay-bound ``ModelProviderPort`` serves a request, end to end.

``ModelProviderPort`` is only worth binding if the request path asks it
(otari#757), and only worth asking if it cannot displace a credential the
gateway already holds. Both are properties of a booted app rather than of a
function, so this exercises them against one: the same config is served by a
gateway with an overlay bootstrap and by a gateway without, and what reaches
any-llm is compared.
