"""Gate on the header naming rule in AGENTS.md: Otari's own headers carry no ``X-`` prefix.

RFC 6648 (BCP 178) retired that convention. Nothing else reaches the rule: it is
prose, no lint rule covers it, and no other test names a header it does not
itself send, so a reintroduced prefix would ship silently.

Every ``X-`` literal under ``src/gateway`` is classified here rather than only the
ones spelled ``X-Otari-``, because a scan for that spelling alone passes a header
of ours named anything else, which is the wider gap. The scan stops at
``src/gateway`` because that is where a header reaches the wire.

Both buckets only shrink. An entry whose literal has left the source fails until
it leaves the bucket too, so a retired name cannot sit here pre-authorizing a
future one.
