"""Per-organization rate overrides: how they resolve, and when they are refused.

Driven against SQLite rather than the integration suite's PostgreSQL, for two
reasons. It is the engine the OSS edition ships by default, so an override that
resolved only on PostgreSQL would be broken for most self-hosters and nothing
else covers that. And the overlap rule is enforced in the service precisely
*because* SQLite cannot express it as a constraint, so SQLite is where that check
has to be shown working.

The HTTP surface (the role gate, the statuses, the envelope) is covered in
`tests/integration/test_organization_pricing_routes.py`, which needs a real
request and a real identity.
