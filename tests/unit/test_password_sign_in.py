"""Password sign-in, and the master key retiring as the dashboard login.

The shape mozilla-ai/otari-ai#1716 settled and issue #649 implements: the master
key bootstraps a standalone deployment, an operator claims the deployment by
setting an address and a password, and from that moment email and password is
the dashboard login while the master key stays the credential for the management
API. Both halves of that sentence are load-bearing and both are asserted here,
because retiring the login and retiring the credential are one edit apart and
the second would break every self-hoster's automation and the OSS smoke gate.

Unit rather than integration: everything under test is route, service and
identity behavior that runs unchanged on the SQLite file each test stands up.
