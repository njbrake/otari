"""The two consolidation revisions' Alembic chain, exercised on SQLite with data.

The OSS base ships SQLite by default, and both revisions drop columns and add a
foreign key on existing tables, neither of which SQLite has an ``ALTER TABLE``
for: Alembic's batch mode rebuilds the table instead, and a rebuild silently
drops what reflection could not see. Both tables carry *partial* unique indexes,
which is exactly that, so ``copy_from`` in each revision is what has to carry
them across.

Every integration run migrates PostgreSQL and nothing migrates SQLite, so this is
the only coverage of that path. Modeled on ``test_scoped_budget_alignment_chain``,
with one addition: both revisions **mint rows**, so this drives them with data and
asserts what the backfill produced, not only that the schema arrived.
