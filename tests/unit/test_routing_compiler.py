"""Unit tests for the routing-policy compiler's empty-plan behavior (issue #463).

A policy that compiles to nothing is the one outcome that has to explain itself,
because the caller sees a failure for a model name that exists. The two ways it
happens are different faults with different fixes, so they get different statuses
and different wording:

- access rules filtered every candidate out: the caller is being denied something
  that does exist, which is a 403 they can act on by asking for access;
- nothing resolves to a configured provider: the gateway's provider config no
  longer matches its policies, which is a 502. The caller did nothing wrong.

Sending 403 with access-rule wording for both told an operator whose provider
instance had been deleted to go audit their allow-lists.
