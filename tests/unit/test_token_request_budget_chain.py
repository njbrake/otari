"""The token and request ceiling revision's Alembic chain, exercised on SQLite.

Sibling of ``test_exact_budget_schema_chain.py``. Two things are worth a test
rather than a reading of the migration:

**A live deployment upgrades into zeroed counters, not into a refusal.** The new
columns are NOT NULL, so every existing row needs a value the moment the column
appears, and every INSERT written before they existed needs one too. A
``server_default`` is what supplies both, and the failure it prevents is not
subtle: without it the upgrade itself fails on any non-empty table, and with the
default declared only in the ORM the first insert from an older code path does.

**The rule that survives a rebuild.** SQLite has no ALTER for much of this, so
the whole point of checking after the upgrade is that ``budgets`` still refuses
a row naming two period sources, which is the constraint a table rebuild is
most likely to drop.
