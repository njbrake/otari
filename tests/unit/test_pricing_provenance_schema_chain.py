"""The pricing-provenance revision's Alembic chain, exercised on SQLite.

The OSS base ships SQLite by default and nothing else in the suite migrates it,
so this is the only coverage of that path for this revision. Three things are
worth pinning beyond "the columns appear". The revision is hand-written, so
nothing else would notice it and the model drifting apart. The lengths are
deliberate (they mirror the platform's ``gateway_usage_settlement`` columns, so a
value copied across by the hosted-usage backfill always fits), and a silently
unbounded column would only be found by the value that overflowed the platform's
own. And the downgrade drops five columns from a table that holds accounting
rows, so the round trip has to show those rows survive it.

The PostgreSQL half is ``tests/integration/test_pricing_provenance_columns.py``.
