"""The tenancy revision's Alembic chain, exercised on SQLite.

The OSS base ships SQLite by default, so the reconciled schema has to migrate
there as well as on PostgreSQL, and this revision has a step that behaves
differently on each: ``user.active_organization_id`` and
``organization.created_by_user_id`` reference each other, so one of the two
foreign keys can only be added after both tables exist. PostgreSQL takes that as
an ``ALTER TABLE``; SQLite has no ``ADD CONSTRAINT``, so Alembic's batch mode
rebuilds the table, which is the step that can silently lose a constraint.

Every integration run migrates PostgreSQL and nothing migrates SQLite, so this
is the only coverage of that path. Driven against a real file database rather
than in-memory because batch mode's rebuild is what is under test.

The later revisions that reshape the same tables are exercised here too, for the
same reason: the workspace scoping that rebuilds four request-plane tables, the
credential columns added to ``user``, whose downgrade depends on SQLite's refusal
to drop an indexed column, the identity column added to ``dashboard_sessions``,
which rebuilds that table to tighten a column to NOT NULL and point it at
``user``, and the two revisions that finish scoping the gateway survivals: one
swaps the alias and policy uniqueness constraints (a batch rebuild with the
partial indexes taken out and put back around it), the other adds
``workspace_id`` to three more tables.

The guardrail definitions revision is here for the same reason and one more: it
is the first to put a *check constraint* and a *composite* foreign key on a
table that already exists, neither of which SQLite can add without rebuilding
it, and the table it rebuilds is one another table's foreign key points at.
