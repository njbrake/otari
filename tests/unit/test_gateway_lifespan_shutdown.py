"""Shutdown must not hang on a background refresher that will not stop.

Cancelling a task is a request, not a guarantee. The CancelledError lands at
whatever the task is awaiting, and a nested anyio cancel scope there can consume
it: ``CancelScope.__exit__`` calls ``host_task.uncancel()`` for each pending
uncancellation whenever its own scope was cancelling, then swallows the error it
sees. httpx and the provider SDKs implement their per-operation timeouts as
exactly those scopes, so a shutdown cancel that races one of their timeouts can
be absorbed. The refresher loop then resumes, falls through to its ``sleep``, and
naps out a whole interval (a day, for the models.dev catalog).

An unbounded ``await task`` after a single ``cancel()`` turns that into an
indefinite hang: the lifespan never finishes, so uvicorn's shutdown (and
``TestClient.__exit__``) blocks forever behind a background refresh.

The tests below model the absorption directly rather than trying to provoke it
through a real socket, because the race needs degraded upstream connectivity to
land and is not reproducible on demand.
