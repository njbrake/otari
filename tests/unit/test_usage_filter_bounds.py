"""Unit tests for UTC pinning of the usage window bounds.

The date query params and selection bodies advertise ISO 8601, so a caller that
omits the offset hands in a naive datetime. asyncpg encodes ``timestamptz`` with
``astimezone``, which reads a naive value as the process's local time, so the same
bound would select a different set of rows per deployment. `/api/v1/usage/summary`
routes through `resolve_window` and was already pinned; the list, count, and bulk
mutation paths do not, so they pin the bound themselves.

The count an operator confirms and the delete that re-derives its target set from
the same body have to mean the same instant, so both sides are asserted here.
