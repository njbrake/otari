"""The money-column revision's Alembic chain, exercised on SQLite.

The OSS base ships SQLite by default, and this revision retypes eleven columns,
which PostgreSQL takes as ``ALTER TABLE`` and SQLite can only do by rebuilding
the table. A rebuild is where a constraint goes missing: SQLite cannot reflect a
CHECK, so ``organization_model_pricing``'s five non-negative-rate checks survive
only because the revision hands batch mode an explicit ``copy_from``. Nothing
else in the suite migrates SQLite, so this is the only coverage of that path.

The repricing half of the file answers the question the change has to answer
before it can be trusted: **does a row priced before the conversion still price
to the same amount after it?** It is asked over the rates a deployment actually
stores, taken from the genai-prices catalog the default price list is built
from, rather than over numbers chosen to make the arithmetic come out even.
