"""Unit tests for the mid-failover reservation top-up (issue #463).

``top_up_reservation_for_attempt`` is the only thing stopping a fallover to a
pricier candidate from spending past a cap the budget gate already approved. The
gate runs once, against the head candidate, so without this a policy whose
``on_failure`` chain climbs in price would serve the expensive model on the cheap
model's hold.

It also carries the ``require_pricing`` gate for fallback candidates, for the
same reason: the admission gate prices only the head, so an unpriced model that
would 402 when named directly would otherwise serve, and log ``cost=null``,
purely by being reached as a fallback.

These are pure unit tests. ``find_model_pricing`` and ``increase_reservation``
are stubbed, so what is pinned is the decision logic: when the hold grows, by how
much, when it does not, and which failure the caller sees.
