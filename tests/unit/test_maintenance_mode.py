"""The login freeze: maintenance mode refusing new dashboard sign-ins.

Issue #717 asks for a switch a platform admin flips so a deployment can be
redeployed without anyone signing in mid-migration. otari.ai's flag of the same
name does not do this (it swaps a view in the browser *after* login and its
`login.tsx` checks nothing), so what is asserted here is the behavior the issue
describes rather than a ported one:

* while it is on, ``POST /api/v1/auth/session`` refuses both credentials with 503;
* a session already minted keeps working, so the operator who flipped the switch
  is not locked out of the dashboard by it;
* the master key through the header is never frozen, which is what guarantees a
  way back out even from a fresh browser;
* the data plane and the rest of the management API are untouched;
* ``GET /api/v1/bootstrap`` publishes it, so the sign-in screen can say what is
  happening rather than presenting a form that can only be refused.

Unit rather than integration: all of it is route and service behavior that runs
unchanged on the SQLite file each test stands up.
