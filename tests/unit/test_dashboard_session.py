"""Dashboard sign-in sessions: mint, identity, cookie auth, revocation, rotation.

Covers the fix for the dashboard losing its sign-in on every tab close or
browser restart (issue #338): the master key is exchanged once for an HttpOnly
session cookie that the master-key auth dependencies accept when a request
carries no header credentials.

It also covers what issue #647 added on top: a session names the identity it was
minted for, so a cookie-authenticated request resolves a user and that user's
active organization rather than only proving the master key was presented once.
The revocation paths are re-asserted here rather than trusted, since binding an
identity to a session is the change most likely to break them silently.
