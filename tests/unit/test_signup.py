"""Signup: claiming a roster identity, and registering one where the deployment allows it.

Unit rather than integration, the same reasoning ``test_password_sign_in.py``
gives: everything under test is route, service and identity behavior that runs
unchanged on the SQLite file each test stands up. Mail runs on the console
transport, which logs the rendered message (including the verification link)
rather than delivering it, the same pattern ``test_invitations_api.py`` uses to
observe an emailed link without a real SMTP server.
