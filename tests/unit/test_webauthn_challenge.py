"""The challenge is spent exactly once, on the engine the OSS edition ships.

`tests/integration/test_webauthn_api.py` covers the ceremonies end to end
against PostgreSQL. This covers the one property that has to hold on SQLite too,
because a standalone deployment defaults to it: consuming a challenge is a
single conditional DELETE reading back what it removed, which needs SQLite's
`RETURNING` (3.35, March 2021). A build older than that would fail here rather
than in a browser, with a passkey sign-in that silently accepted replays.

    This pins what the routes actually do rather than what "single use" sounds

    route commits on a refusal, so the challenge is still there afterwards and
    dies on its TTL instead.
