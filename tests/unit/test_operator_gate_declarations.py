"""The deployment-wide routers declare the operator gate on themselves.

`tests/integration/test_deployment_operator_gate.py` asserts what the gate does
over HTTP, and why it exists at all (otari-ai#1880). This file asserts where it
is declared, which is the other half: the gate used to be a decorator on each
route, every one of them correct, and the hazard was the next route someone
added. One forgotten `dependencies=[...]` and a deployment-wide handler is
reachable with no credential at all, which no roster of probes can notice
because the probes name paths and the missing path is the one nobody wrote
(otari-ai#1937).

Read from the routers rather than from a running app: this is a claim about the
declarations, it needs no database, and a route that never reached the app is
still a route somebody will mount.
