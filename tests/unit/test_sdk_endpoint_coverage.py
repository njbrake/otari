"""Endpoint-coverage drift gate for the SDK manifest.

Checks ``scripts/sdk_codegen/sdk-endpoints.txt`` against
``docs/public/openapi.json`` from the same commit. Adding a gateway endpoint
fails here until it is classified as ``[covered]`` or ``[excluded]``.

This lives in the gateway rather than in the four SDK repos on purpose. The SDK
copies of the manifest are pushed by the codegen workflow, and their own checks
cannot see a spec change until a regen lands, so a gateway-side gate is what
catches drift at the moment it is introduced. Both files are read from disk, so
the result depends only on the commit under test.
