"""Unit tests for the diff `otari hook` hands a judge gate.

Against a real repository, unlike tests/unit/test_hook_cli.py, which mocks
the Git boundary: what is under test here is which files Git reports and how
their content is rendered, so a mocked `subprocess.run` would only assert
that the fixture matches itself.
