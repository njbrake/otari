"""Unit tests for handing the request's connection back before the provider call.

The preamble reads the API key, the billed user and the workspace's tool rows
on the request-scoped session, which holds its connection until something ends
the transaction. Nothing in the preamble commits, so before this the connection
stayed checked out for the whole upstream call and
``db_pool_size + db_max_overflow`` became a ceiling on concurrent provider
calls. Past it a request waits ``db_pool_timeout`` and is then refused by the
auth dependency, which reports a pool timeout as
"Authentication temporarily unavailable, please retry".
