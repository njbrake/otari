"""Writing a rejection row must never change the response the caller gets.

Every gateway-side rejection site logs the drop and then re-raises the refusal
it was already going to return (see ``log_gateway_rejection``). If the log write
escaped as an exception, an unhealthy log writer would turn a clean 403 or 400
into a 500 and look to the client like a broken gateway. These pin that the
write is best-effort in both directions: a failure is swallowed, and a healthy
writer still gets its row.
