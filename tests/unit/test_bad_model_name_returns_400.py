"""Unit tests for fix: unparseable / unknown-provider model names return 400.

Previously ValueError / AnyLLMError from resolve_provider_selector escaped
as a bare 500.  The fix adds _raise_for_unresolvable_model (called by
resolve_dispatch_provider and every bare resolve_provider_selector site) to
map both exception types to HTTP 400 with a helpful detail string.

These tests cover:
- _raise_for_unresolvable_model maps ValueError -> 400 with model name in detail
- _raise_for_unresolvable_model maps AnyLLMError -> 400 with model name in detail
- resolve_dispatch_provider falls through to the guard when ctx.resolved_provider is None
- resolve_dispatch_provider returns cached provider when ctx.resolved_provider is set
