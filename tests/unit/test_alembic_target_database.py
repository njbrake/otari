"""Which database otari's migration chain is willing to run against.

Otari stamps the default ``alembic_version`` table, the same one every other
Alembic application stamps, so nothing about a URL says whose database it names.
Two ways a deployment ends up pointed at someone else's, both seen in practice
when otari's control plane runs beside an older application: the process
inherits that application's ``DATABASE_URL``, or it is handed one outright.
Alembic's own report of that is "Can't locate revision identified by ...", which
reads as a corrupt database rather than as a URL naming the wrong one.
