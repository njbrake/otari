"""``b7e1c4a9d2f5``'s ownership backfill, on SQLite, over the three populations.

The revision adds ``budgets.organization_id`` and then assigns it, but only in
the one case where assigning grants nobody anything they did not already hold: a
deployment with exactly one organization, whose operator is that organization's
owner. Getting the guard wrong in the permissive direction would hand one
tenant's admins authority over a cap set above them, so the guard is what is
under test here rather than the ADD COLUMN.

SQLite because the OSS base ships it by default and because the revision goes
through ``batch_alter_table`` to add its foreign key, which is the SQLite-only
path and the one where a table rebuild can drop a constraint.
