"""Rule-coverage manifest: parsing and drift detection.

A skill under ``.github/skills/`` is the long form of a standard, written for
whoever is editing the code. Its counterpart under ``.github/instructions/`` is
the short form CodeRabbit loads as review guidance, and it is a deliberate
compression: one numbered rung carries what several skill sections say, phrased
as what is a finding rather than as how to write code. Nothing has ever compared
the two, so a rule could be stated in one and absent from the other, and the only
thing that noticed was a person asking.

A manifest classifies every skill heading as ``[covered]`` by a named rung or
``[excluded]`` with a reason, and the checks below assert the map is total in
both directions: a heading nothing classifies fails, an entry naming a heading
that no longer exists fails, and a rung that no entry names (or that the
instructions no longer number) fails too. Adding a section to a topic guide then
fails the repository's own tests until somebody decides whether a reviewer needs
it, which is a sentence of work at the moment the decision is cheap.

The comparison is structural on purpose. The two layers say the same thing in
deliberately different words, so anything comparing wording would fight that
difference forever.

Format: ``[covered]`` / ``[excluded]`` sections, one ``<file> :: <heading>`` per
line. Inside ``[covered]`` a ``rung <n>`` line opens the run of headings that
rung carries. An entry takes an optional ``# reason`` trailer, required under
``[excluded]``. Blank lines and ``#`` lines are ignored.
