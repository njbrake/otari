"""Boot Otari as the OSS edition and smoke it end to end.

ARCHITECTURE.md promises that every milestone ships a standalone OSS edition:
Otari must boot with only its own adapters bound, no overlay bootstrap and no
platform token, and still serve a real request. Without one automated check that
proves it, the promise is an assertion, and the first change that quietly makes
an OSS path depend on an enterprise adapter merges green and breaks self-hosting.

This is that check. It boots the packaged CLI as a subprocess (not an in-process
TestClient) so a failure to *start* counts as a failure, then walks the path a
self-hoster walks on day one:

1. ``/api/v1/health``, ``/api/v1/health/liveness``, ``/api/v1/health/readiness`` answer.
2. Readiness reports no ``mode``, which is what standalone looks like: hybrid
   mode stamps ``mode: hybrid`` on both health payloads, so the absence is the
   assertion that no platform token selected the other edition behind our back.
3. ``/api/v1/bootstrap`` answers with no credential and reports ``standalone``. It is
   the first request a browser makes, and a second statement of which edition
   booted.
4. Create a user, then an API key for it (master-key admin surface).
5. Register a BYO provider credential at runtime, which is stored encrypted.
6. Create a routing policy whose default candidate fails and whose ``on_failure``
   candidate is that BYO provider.
7. Send one chat completion at the policy. It can only succeed by failing over to
   the BYO candidate and presenting the stored key to the provider, so a 200 with
   the expected body proves credential storage, routing, fallback, and dispatch
   all work in the OSS edition.
8. The usage row for that request is readable back through ``/api/v1/usage``.
9. Mail, which this deployment never configured, reports itself unavailable and
   names what would turn it on, and a send is refused rather than accepted and
   dropped. That is the state every self-hoster who wants no email is in, so it
   is the state the gate has to prove still boots and still says so honestly.

Both provider endpoints are a mock OpenAI-compatible server this script runs, so
the gate needs no provider secret and runs identically on a fork PR.

Standard library only, and no dev dependencies, on purpose: CI runs it against a
runtime-only environment (``uv sync --frozen --no-dev``), so an enterprise-only
or dev-only import that reached an OSS code path fails here rather than passing
on a developer machine that happens to have it installed.

Usage:
    uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py
    uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py --database-url postgresql://...
