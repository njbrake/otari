"""Generate language SDK clients from the otari OpenAPI spec via OpenAPI Generator.

Two modes:

- ``control-plane`` (default): typed clients for the management endpoints only
  (keys, users, budgets, pricing, usage). The inference surface stays a
  hand-written wrapper around the official OpenAI SDK; batches are hand-written
  (their responses are untyped in the spec).

- ``full``: enriches the spec's inference surface with the real typed
  completion schemas (from ``any-llm``), then generates a typed core covering
  *every* endpoint. The SDK hand-writes a thin shell over this core for the
  three things generation can't do: streaming (SSE), typed error mapping, and
  ergonomic method names / auth modes.

Usage:
    python scripts/sdk_codegen/generate.py --language python --out-dir dist
    python scripts/sdk_codegen/generate.py --language all --mode full

The OpenAPI Generator CLI must be on PATH (or set OPENAPI_GENERATOR_CLI). It
requires a JRE. Install with:
    npm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
