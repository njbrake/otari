"""Check gateway architectural boundaries.

Enforces:
1. Service layer boundaries: services must not import the API layer.
2. API route purity: routes must not use the sync ORM layer (sqlalchemy.orm).
3. Repository boundaries: repositories must not import services or the API layer.
4. Naming conventions: repository modules end in _repository.py.
5. OSS/enterprise boundary: OSS code must not import the enterprise overlay.
6. Port boundaries: a port may describe the domain but not import a caller or an adapter.
7. Composition root: only gateway/container.py may name a concrete adapter.
8. Entrypoint purity: gateway/main.py may not import a route module.
