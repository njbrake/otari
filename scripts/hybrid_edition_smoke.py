"""Boot Otari in hybrid mode against a fake control plane and smoke the tool paths.

The dev gateway at otari.ai deploys from this repository's ``main`` on every
merge, against a control plane pinned to an older release. Every merge is
therefore an integration test between this gateway and a peer it has never met,
run in a live environment with no gate in front of it. The hybrid tests in
``tests/integration`` fake the peer with hand-written dicts, which proves the
gateway handles *its own idea* of the platform. What nothing proves is what the
gateway **sends**: a request body the deployed peer would reject merges green.

This is that gate. It boots the packaged CLI as a subprocess with a platform
token set, so hybrid mode is selected the way a deployment selects it, and
stands up three standard-library fakes: the control plane, an OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible provider, and a streamable-HTTP MCP server. Every fake
records what it was asked, and the assertions are on those records as much as
on the responses, because the record is the half of the wire contract no other
test reads.

It walks:

1. Health and readiness report ``mode: hybrid`` with the platform reachable, and
   the bootstrap answers ``hybrid``; the management API is not mounted.
2. A chat completion: the resolve body names the model and provider the caller
   asked for, both tokens travel, the attempt's credential reaches the provider,
   and the usage report that follows names the winning attempt.
3. Budget and rate refusals from the control plane (402, 429 with Retry-After,
   401) reach the caller with the platform's own detail, and no provider call
   or usage report is made for a request the platform refused.
4. Managed web search: the Web Access resolve carries ``requested_tools``, the
   search query reaches the platform-hosted backend with the gateway token, and
   the result feeds the model's second turn.
5. Managed web fetch is off by default: declaring it is refused before any
   resolve is attempted.
6. MCP through the managed tool loop, inline and by workspace id: the id resolve
   carries the ids, the server sees initialize, tools/list and tools/call, and
   the tool result feeds the model's second turn.
7. Provider-native code execution is forwarded untouched when no sandbox is
   configured: Anthropic's dated tool on Messages, OpenAI's ``code_interpreter``
   on Responses, each answered in its own native result blocks.

8. Provider-native web search is forwarded the same way (``web_search_intercept``
   is off by default): Anthropic's ``web_search_20250305`` on Messages, OpenAI's
   ``web_search_preview`` on Responses, each answered in its own result blocks.
9. A streamed completion, which is how most callers actually read a model: the
   gateway injects ``stream_options.include_usage`` so a cost can be settled, the
   frames reach the caller as ``text/event-stream``, and the usage report carries
   the ``ttft_ms`` that only a streamed attempt produces.

Standard library only, and no dev dependencies, for the same reason as
``oss_edition_smoke.py``: CI runs it against ``uv sync --frozen --no-dev``, so a
dev-only import on a hybrid code path fails here.

``--live`` keeps the fake control plane and MCP server but points the resolved
attempts at the real OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, with keys read from
``OTARI_SMOKE_OPENAI_API_KEY`` and ``OTARI_SMOKE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` (models from
``OTARI_SMOKE_OPENAI_MODEL`` and ``OTARI_SMOKE_ANTHROPIC_MODEL``). Managed web
search then runs a real model against the fake search backend, or against Tavily
when ``OTARI_SMOKE_TAVILY_API_KEY`` is also set. The fakes cannot record the
provider side, so those assertions are skipped and the prompts force each tool
with ``tool_choice``; what a live run adds is the class the fakes encode only a
belief about: whether the pinned SDKs still parse a real response, whether a
real model drives the managed loop, and whether the native tools still exist
under the names the gateway forwards. It runs on pushes to ``main``, which is
also the commit the dev gateway deploys.

``--image`` runs the same walk against the published container instead of a
source checkout, which is what a deployment actually runs: the image's own
filesystem, entrypoint and baked dependencies. ``otari-docker-build.yml`` proves
today only that the container answers its health probes, so an image that boots
but cannot serve a request is a break nothing here catches, and that class of
break is the one that took otari-ai's dev deployment down. The fakes then bind
every interface and the container reaches them through ``host.docker.internal``,
so the run works the same on a Linux runner and on Docker Desktop.

Usage:
    uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/hybrid_edition_smoke.py
    uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/hybrid_edition_smoke.py --live
    uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/hybrid_edition_smoke.py --image otari:pr-sha
