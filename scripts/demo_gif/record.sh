# Regenerate assets/otari-demo.gif: seed a standalone gateway, drive the
# dashboard through a full page sweep with Playwright, and encode the recording
# to an optimized GIF.
#
# Prereqs (installed once in the dev/sandbox environment):
#   - ffmpeg on PATH                     (webm -> gif)
#   - gifsicle on PATH                   (lossy GIF optimisation)
#   - web deps installed: (cd web && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
#   - a built dashboard bundle in src/gateway/static/dashboard, which is
#     gitignored, so a fresh clone has none (build with: make dashboard)
#
# Usage: bash scripts/demo_gif/record.sh [--keep-server]
