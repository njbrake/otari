"""Seed the smoke gateway with three people to sign in as, once.

Run by ``run.sh`` after the gateway answers ``/health``. Standard library
only, so it runs on any host with Python 3. Idempotent by way of the marker
``run.sh`` writes after a successful seed; ``--reset`` clears it with the
database.

What it makes:

- **Platform admin.** The bootstrap operator, claimed with an email and a
  password. Deployment-wide standing: Settings, the catalog and price controls
  on Providers, Accounts, every provider. The master key stays the API
  credential.
- **Org admin.** ``Acme``, a second organization, with an admin who can set
  Acme's rate overrides, provider keys, members and budgets but not the
  deployment's.
- **Member.** A plain member of Acme: reads the catalog at Acme's rates,
  makes their own API keys, sees their own usage.

Both Acme people are added to the roster, then claimed through signup and
verified from the link the console mail transport writes to the gateway log,
which is the path a real invitee walks with real mail.
