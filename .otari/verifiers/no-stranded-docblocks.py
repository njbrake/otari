"""check_passed verifier: fails when a docblock in web/src sits directly above
a declaration it does not document (AGENTS.md, "Repository Conventions").

Run with cwd at the repo root. Exit 0 is pass, 1 is fail, anything else is
error, per docs/agent-guardrails.md's check_passed exit-code contract. Python's
own `re`, not a shelled-out `grep`, is what makes the match itself correct:
the pattern spans a newline, which a real `grep -P` invocation only handles
portably with `--null-data`, and BSD grep has no `-P` at all either way.

Scoped to files that actually changed (working tree vs HEAD, the same
"changed" `otari hook` itself submits as evidence), not a scan of the whole
web/src tree: web/src carries pre-existing violations this one script did
not introduce, and a whole-tree scan would fail this gate on every future
change to web/src regardless of what that change touched. Touching a file
that already has one still flags it (the same "if you touch it, fix it"
rule linters scoped to a diff already follow), which is a much narrower
surface than every unrelated edit in the directory.
