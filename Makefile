# Build the dashboard bundle the gateway serves at "/". Not committed, so run
# this to see the dashboard from a source checkout (without it the gateway
# degrades to the tutorial page) and before building a wheel. The Docker image
# builds it in its own web stage and needs no local Node.

# Reinstalling on every rebuild is the wrong price to pay now that the READMEs
# send developers to `make dashboard` to see the dashboard locally. Gate it on a
# stamp of our own rather than on one of pnpm's metadata files: pnpm writes both
# `.modules.yaml` and `.pnpm/lock.yaml`, but it leaves their mtimes alone when
# an install turns out to be a no-op, so either one can sit older than the
# lockfile forever and the gate would never close. Touching the stamp ourselves
# records what the rule actually cares about, which is that an install ran
# against this lockfile. `--frozen-lockfile` is the `npm ci` of pnpm: it
# installs exactly the lockfile and fails rather than rewriting it when
# package.json has moved on.
