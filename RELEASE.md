# Releasing

This document covers releasing Otari. The language SDKs release
separately on their own tracks; see [SDK releases](#sdk-releases) below.

## Releasing Otari

Otari is distributed as a Docker image (`docker.io/mzdotai/otari`). There is no
package publish and no version file to bump: the runtime version comes from the
git tag, baked in as the `OTARI_VERSION` build arg (see `src/gateway/version.py`).

`CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub Release body are generated from Conventional
Commits by [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) (config in
[`cliff.toml`](cliff.toml)), at release time, not on every PR. Generating once
per release (rather than regenerating and re-committing the file on every PR)
keeps the changelog out of day-to-day diffs, so feature PRs never collide on it
and nobody hand-curates release notes. Correctness comes from the commit
messages: the only per-PR requirement is a conventional PR title, which the
**Otari PR Title Check** enforces. See
[Changelog visibility](#changelog-visibility) for which commit types appear.

### Steps

The release runs in two halves so the changelog is reviewable before the tag:

1. **Open the release PR.** Trigger the **Otari Release (open PR)**
   (`otari-release.yml`) workflow from the Actions UI with the target version
   (for example `0.4.0`). It regenerates `CHANGELOG.md` for `v0.4.0` and opens a
   `release/v0.4.0` PR labeled `release` with the rendered notes in the body.
   A release that contains a breaking change needs a larger version; see
   [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes).
2. **Merge it.** Review the changelog diff and squash-merge the PR.
   **Otari Release (tag + publish)** (`otari-tag-release.yml`) then tags the
   squash commit `v0.4.0` and publishes the GitHub Release with the git-cliff
   notes. Creating the Release is what creates the tag.

For a local preview of what the next release notes will look like, run
`make changelog` (set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to resolve PR and author links).

Three workflows react to the published Release:

- **`otari-docker.yml`** builds and pushes the multi-arch image to Docker Hub,
  tagged `{{version}}` (e.g. `0.4.0`), `{{major}}.{{minor}}` (e.g. `0.4`), and the
  short commit SHA. The release tag is baked in as the `OTARI_VERSION` build
  arg, so the running Otari reports it on `/health` and in the OpenAPI
  `info.version`.
- **`otari-sdk-codegen.yml`** regenerates each SDK's typed core, stamps the
  release version into the core, and opens a regeneration PR on each SDK repo.
- **`otari-homebrew.yml`** ships the agent-side CLI (`cli/`, distribution
  `otari-agent`) to `mozilla-ai/homebrew-tap`. It stamps the version into the
  package, builds its sdist, renders `Formula/otari.rb` from
  `packaging/homebrew/otari.rb.tmpl` and the lock (`scripts/homebrew_formula.py`),
  uploads the sdist, the pinned requirements and the formula to the Release,
  installs and `brew test`s the formula on a macOS runner, then commits it to
  the tap, so `brew install mozilla-ai/tap/otari` follows every release.

### Continuous (non-release) builds

Every push to `main` that touches the service also builds and pushes a Docker
image tagged `latest` and the short SHA, with `OTARI_VERSION` set to the commit
SHA. These are not releases; only a published GitHub Release produces a
semver-tagged image.

### Changelog visibility

`CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub Release body are generated from the Conventional
Commit messages on `main`. Otari squash-merges PRs (squash title = PR title), so
the PR title is what git-cliff parses; the **Otari PR Title Check**
(`otari-pr-title.yml`) enforces a conventional title on every PR.

User-visible prefixes appear in release notes:

- `feat:` new user-visible behavior
- `fix:` bug fixes that affect users
- `perf:` performance improvements
- `security:` security fixes
- `revert:` reverts of previously released changes

Routine maintenance is intentionally hidden: `chore:` (including `chore(deps):`
and `chore: release`), `build:`, `ci:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`.
Scope visibility via the prefix: `feat(web): ...` / `fix(web): ...` show up;
`refactor(web):` / `chore(web):` / `test(web):` stay out. A breaking change is
never hidden: see [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes).

A non-conventional title is not silently dropped: `cliff.toml`'s catch-all parser
routes anything without a recognized prefix into a generic "Other" group, and the
release workflow fails if git-cliff still flags a parse-error skip. The PR Title
Check refuses the merge before that can happen, so "Other" should only ever catch
direct pushes to `main`.

### Breaking changes

A change is breaking when a deployment must do work of its own to upgrade. For
example, a new required method on a port breaks every adapter that a deployment
wrote against the old port.

Mark a breaking change with `!` in the PR title, after the type or the scope:
`feat(api)!: remove GET /v1/usage/summary.csv`. The squash title is what
git-cliff parses. git-cliff also reads a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, but a footer
reaches the squash commit only from a branch commit message, so do not rely on it.

The release notes put the marker **BREAKING:** at the start of each breaking
entry. The entry stays in the group of its type. A breaking commit of a hidden
type, such as `refactor(ports)!:`, appears under "Maintenance".

A release that contains a breaking change raises the minor version while Otari is
below 1.0 (`0.6.3` becomes `0.7.0`), and the major version from 1.0 on. The
**Otari Release (open PR)** workflow compares the requested version with the last
release tag. When the version is too small, it puts a warning at the top of the
release PR body. It does not stop the release.

### Prerequisites (repository secrets)

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, used by `otari-docker.yml` to push
  the image.
- `SDK_CODEGEN_TOKEN`, used by `otari-sdk-codegen.yml` to open regeneration PRs
  on the SDK repos.
- `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`, used by `otari-homebrew.yml` to push
  `Formula/otari.rb` to `mozilla-ai/homebrew-tap`. It is the org secret mcpd
  and cq publish with, granted per repository, so an org admin has to add this
  repository to it. Until then the workflow's build and macOS jobs still run
  and the rendered formula sits on the Release as `otari.rb`; only the push to
  the tap fails.
- `RELEASE_APP_CLIENT_ID` (a repository variable, not a secret) and
  `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, used by `otari-release.yml` and
  `otari-tag-release.yml`. They identify the `otari-bot` GitHub App, org-owned
  and installed on this repo alone, holding exactly `contents: write` +
  `pull requests: write`. Each run mints its own installation token with
  `actions/create-github-app-token`, narrowed further to the permissions that
  job uses and revoked when the job ends, so the release PR is authored by
  `otari-bot[bot]` rather than by whichever maintainer owned a personal access
  token. The private key itself does not expire, so it remains the one
  long-lived credential in the release path and is worth rotating on the same
  cadence as any other: what the App buys is a narrower blast radius and an
  identity that outlives any individual, not the removal of a standing secret.

  The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be used in its place, because events it
  creates start no workflows: a PR it opened would run neither the PR title
  check nor the template check, and a Release it published would not trigger
  `otari-docker.yml`, so no image would be built. An App installation token is a
  distinct identity and does start them. Until these exist, only the release
  workflows are blocked; normal development is unaffected.

## SDK releases

The four language SDKs (`otari-sdk-python`, `otari-sdk-ts`, `otari-sdk-go`,
`otari-sdk-rust`) are versioned independently of Otari and release on their
own tracks with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). A
Otari release does not release any SDK; it only opens the regeneration PRs
described above. A maintainer reviews and merges each, after which that SDK's own
release-please flow opens a release PR, and merging it cuts and publishes that
SDK's release.

For the full model (the spec-version compatibility scheme, the two-merge
lifecycle, and the per-SDK registries and secrets) see
[`docs/sdk-compatibility.md`](docs/sdk-compatibility.md) and each SDK repo's
`RELEASE.md`.
