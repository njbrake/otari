# Contributing to Otari

## Before you start

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/issues) and [open PRs](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/pulls) to avoid duplicates.
- For significant changes (new endpoints, auth changes, breaking config changes, new dependencies), open an issue first to align on approach.
- All contributors must follow Mozilla's [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/).

## Is this an Otari change or an any-llm change?

Otari dispatches every provider call through
[any-llm](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm). Much of what looks like an
Otari bug is a provider integration bug, and fixing it here means patching
around the SDK instead of fixing it for every any-llm user. Work out which repo
owns the change before writing code.

**The seam:** any-llm owns talking to a provider. Otari owns deciding whether a
call happens, with which credentials, and what it cost.

**The test:** reproduce it without Otari. If a direct any-llm call shows the same
behavior, it belongs upstream.

```python
# pip install "any-llm-sdk[all]"
import asyncio
from any_llm import acompletion

print(asyncio.run(acompletion(
    model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",   # your provider:model
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    # plus the param or option you think Otari is mishandling
)))
```

**File it in [any-llm](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/any-llm/issues) if:**

- a provider is unsupported, or needs a new implementation
- a request param is dropped or mistranslated on the way to a provider SDK
- a provider's response or stream chunks are not normalized to the OpenAI shape
- `list_models` behavior, a provider capability flag, a credential env var name, or a default base URL is wrong
- a provider SDK upgrade breaks the call itself

**File it here if it touches:**

- keys, users, orgs, workspaces, budgets, usage records, or pricing
- route schemas, the OpenAPI spec, or the Anthropic and Responses envelopes
- routing, fallback across attempts, or routing memory
- `config.yml` layering, the `providers:` block, or provider instances and aliases
- the dashboard, built-in tools, the MCP loop, guardrails, or hybrid mode

Two things that look upstream but are ours: the per-provider setup guides in
`docs/providers/`, and how a provider error becomes a status code and a
sanitized message.

### When the fix is upstream but Otari cannot wait

Otari sometimes has to carry a workaround while any-llm catches up. That is a
legitimate PR here, with conditions: keep the shim as small as the problem
allows, comment it with a link to the any-llm issue, and open an Otari issue to
remove it once the SDK pin moves. `service_tier` in
`src/gateway/api/routes/chat.py` is the worked example. File the upstream issue
first; a shim with no upstream issue is permanent by accident.

## Does this change belong in Otari?

Decide where a change goes before writing it. There are four answers.

| The change | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| A feature most deployments want, that the project will maintain | A pull request to Otari |
| A different implementation of something Otari already has, such as a search backend, a telemetry store or an identity policy | Configuration, or an adapter for a port Otari already has. Where Otari has no port for it yet, the port itself is a pull request to Otari |
| Something only one deployment wants, or that the project will not maintain | That deployment's overlay |
| Code loaded into a running gateway at runtime, from an installed package, a directory or a download | Not supported |

**For a change proposed to core**, maintainers weigh three things:

- whether most deployments want it
- whether the project can maintain it
- whether it is secure, and respects the terms of any third-party service it calls

A change that most deployments do not want, or that the project cannot
maintain, still has a home in its deployment's overlay, maintained by the
people who run that deployment.

Code in the gateway's process has the gateway's access to credentials, the
database and every request, so it is chosen when a deployment is built and
never installed into a running gateway. That is why the last row is not
supported, and why the boundary check refuses package discovery in Otari's
code.

[Where new code goes](ARCHITECTURE.md#where-new-code-goes) maps each kind of
change to its mechanism, and
[How a port is resolved](ARCHITECTURE.md#how-a-port-is-resolved) explains ports
and overlays. If no row fits, open an issue and ask.

## Dev setup

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.13+, `uv`, Docker (for integration tests).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari
cd otari
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --dev
cp config.example.yml config.yml
# Set master_key and at least one provider. If you don't have a local Postgres,
# change database_url to: sqlite+aiosqlite:///./otari.db
uv run otari serve --config config.yml
```

For hot reload: `make dev`.

The `otari` command itself is owned by the workspace member at `cli/` (the
`otari-agent` distribution), which holds the laptop-side commands (`hook`,
`import`) and none of the server. `uv sync` installs it next to the gateway, and
the gateway attaches `serve` and the other server commands to it, so the one
`otari` in your venv has both sets. See [cli/README.md](cli/README.md) for
building it alone.

## Making changes

Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`.

```bash
git checkout -b fix/your-description
```

After making changes:

```bash
make lint        # architecture check + ruff
make typecheck   # mypy --strict
make test        # unit + integration
```

Run a single test: `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_gateway_cli.py -v`

If you changed any API routes or schemas, regenerate both generated artifacts and commit them:

```bash
uv run python scripts/generate_openapi.py
uv run python scripts/generate_postman.py
make openapi-check
make postman-check
```

## Dependencies

Most dependencies are floored (`>=`) rather than pinned, and `uv.lock` is committed
because CI and the Docker image both install from it with `--frozen`. Two mechanisms
keep it current, and they cover different things:

- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) opens weekly version-update PRs for the
  `uv` and `github-actions` ecosystems. Security updates are separate, need no
  config, and already cover every supported ecosystem here. The dashboard is not
  covered by either right now; see #1001.
- **`.github/workflows/otari-lock-refresh.yml`** re-resolves `uv.lock` weekly against
  the newest versions the existing constraints already allow, which is the case
  Dependabot does not open PRs for. A floored dependency can otherwise stay at
  whatever version was current the day it was first locked.

To do either by hand:

```bash
uv lock --upgrade --dry-run                    # what would move, and to where
uv lock --upgrade-package genai-prices         # refresh one package
uv lock --upgrade                              # refresh everything
```

A change to dependency resolution also owes the OSS-edition smoke gate, which boots
the packaged CLI with no dev dependencies:

```bash
uv run --frozen --no-dev python scripts/oss_edition_smoke.py
```

## Tests

- New features need tests covering the happy path and error cases.
- Unit tests for pure logic (`tests/unit/`), integration tests for route or database behavior (`tests/integration/`).
- Integration tests require PostgreSQL. They start Testcontainers by default;
  without Docker, set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a test server where workers may
  create and drop databases. Never use production, and do not run concurrent
  suites against the same server URL because their worker database names collide.

## Pull requests

- PR titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/); CI enforces this.
- PRs are squash-merged, so the title is what ends up in the changelog.
- Mark a breaking change with `!` in the title, for example `feat(api)!: ...`. See [Breaking changes](RELEASE.md#breaking-changes).
- Keep diffs focused; avoid unrelated refactors in the same PR.
- Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md`; it is regenerated from commit history at release time.
- The PR description must keep the **PR Type**, **Checklist**, and **AI Usage** sections from the [PR template](https://github.com/mozilla-ai/otari/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md). CI checks for these sections and will auto-close PRs that are missing them after 24 hours.
